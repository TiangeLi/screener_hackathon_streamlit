Higher Than Expected Association of Clinical Prostate and Bladder Cancers,Singh A.; Kinoshita Y.; Rovito Jr. P.M.; Landas S.; Silberstein J.; Nsouli I.; Wang C.Y.; Haas G.P. ,"Purpose: In this study we evaluated the risk of a second malignancy of the bladder or prostate in patients with a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) or urothelial cancer (TCC). Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed all cases of PCa and TCC diagnosed between January 1996 and June 2003. Only PCa diagnosed due to abnormal digital rectal examination or increased prostate specific antigen were included. All patients with TCC presented with hematuria or irritative voiding symptoms and the diagnoses were confirmed with a tissue diagnosis. The incidence of lung, colon and renal cancers was also analyzed. Result(s): A total of 816 men were diagnosed with PCa and/or TCC. Of 673 men initially diagnosed with PCa 21 had TCC. Of 149 men initially diagnosed with TCC 18 had PCa. Average age at PCa and TCC diagnosis +/- SD was 68.2 +/- 7.9 and 68.2 +/- 10.4 years, respectively. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of TCC in patients with PCa (SIR 4.31, 95% CI 2.411 to 7.110) and of PCa in patients with TCC (SIR 3.83, 95% CI 1.911 to 6.858) was significantly increased. There was no statistical significant difference in SIR for TCC in men with or without radiotherapy. SIR for lung, renal or colon cancer was not significantly different from what was expected. Conclusion(s): Patients with PCa have higher incidence of bladder cancer and those with bladder cancer have a higher incidence of PCa. This study has clinical implications in the care of these patients and it may stimulate research interest that may identify common pathways of carcinogenesis. © 2008 American Urological Association.",2008,/,Journal of Urology,179,5 SUPPL.,S2-S5,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2008.03.130,351483910,#5231,Singh 2008,,
Second primary cancer after radiotherapy for prostate cancer--a seer analysis of brachytherapy versus external beam radiotherapy.,"Abdel-Wahab, May; Reis, Isildinha M; Hamilton, Kara","PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of second primary cancers (SPCs) and radiotherapy-induced SPCs (RTSPCs)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of SPCs and RTSPCs was compared among four treatment groups with locoregional prostate adenocarcinoma in the 1973-2002 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. These groups were no radiotherapy (RT), no surgery (Group 1); external beam RT (EBRT) (Group 2); brachytherapy (Group 3); and a combination of EBRT and brachytherapy (Group 4)., RESULTS: The age-adjusted estimates of SPCs were greater with EBRT than with brachytherapy (2,178 vs. 1,901 SPCs/100,000; p = 0.025) or with the no RT, no surgery group (1,971 SPCs/100,000; p <0.0001). The age-adjusted rate of late SPC (>or=5 years) for EBRT (2,425 SPCs/100,000) was only significantly greater (p <0.0001) than that for no RT, no surgery (1,950 SPCs/100,000). The hazard ratio adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and grade was constant at 1.263 for EBRT compared with no RT, no surgery (p <0.0001) but varied with the length of follow-up in both the brachytherapy (0.721 at 5 years to 1.200 at 9 years) and combination (0.920 at 5 years to 1.317 at 9 years) groups. The incidence of RTSPCs was only significantly different between the no RT, no surgery group and the EBRT group, with an increase of 162 cases/100,000 or a 0.16% increased SPC risk (p = 0.023). No significant differences in the incidence of RTSPC were seen between the RT groups., CONCLUSION: No significant differences were seen in the incidence of RTSPCs between the RT groups. The initial smaller relative risk of overall SPCs in the brachytherapy group increased with time until the curves converged, suggesting that the effect had resulted from patient selection bias.",2008,/,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",72,1,58-68,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.12.043,18374503,#3054,Abdel-Wahab 2008,,
The characteristics of bladder cancer after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.,"Abern, Michael R; Dude, Annie M; Tsivian, Matvey; Coogan, Christopher L","OBJECTIVES: Prostate radiotherapy (RT) has been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer (CaB). However it is unknown how prior RT affects the stage, grade, and histology of secondary CaB. While irradiated patients have adverse surgical outcomes, how RT affects survival is also unknown. We sought to determine how RT for prostate cancer (CaP) affects the characteristics and outcomes of secondary CaB., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 275,200 cases of clinically localized CaP submitted to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 1988 and 2007 was performed. CaP treatment was stratified by radical prostatectomy (RP) alone, RT, or RP + RT. Diagnosis of CaB at least 1 year after CaP, and CaB death were the primary outcomes. The stage, grade, and histology of CaB of patients exposed to RT or RP were compared. A competing risks multivariable survival analysis was performed to determine the effect of RT on CaB-specific mortality., RESULTS: CaP patients treated with any RT were 1.70 times as likely to develop CaB (95% CI 1.57-1.86, P < 0.001) compared with RP alone. CaB in men who had RT were more likely non-urothelial (6.4% vs. 3.8%, P = 0.004), trigonal (6.9% vs. 5.4%, P = 0.012), and carcinoma in-situ (CIS) (9.2% vs. 7.0%, P < 0.001) compared with RP. RT increased CaB-specific mortality (HR = 1.30, P = 0.02), which remained significant when adjusted for CaB features (HR = 1.28, P = 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with localized CaP treated with RT have a higher risk of CaB. CaB after RT is more likely to be located at the trigone and contain CIS. Patients with CaB after RT have decreased cancer-specific survival compared with those undergoing RP alone.

Increased risk of rectal cancer after prostate radiation: a population-based study.,"Baxter, Nancy N; Tepper, Joel E; Durham, Sara B; Rothenberger, David A; Virnig, Beth A","BACKGROUND & AIMS: Radiation therapy for prostate cancer has been associated with an increased rate of pelvic malignancies, particularly bladder cancer. The association between radiation therapy and colorectal cancer has not been established., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry data from 1973 through 1994. We focused on men with prostate cancer, but with no previous history of colorectal cancer, treated with either surgery or radiation who survived at least 5 years. We evaluated the effect of radiation on development of cancer for 3 sites: definitely irradiated sites (rectum), potentially irradiated sites (rectosigmoid, sigmoid, and cecum), and nonirradiated sites (the rest of the colon). Using a proportional hazards model, we evaluated the effect of radiation on development of colorectal cancer over time., RESULTS: A total of 30,552 men received radiation, and 55,263 underwent surgery only. Colorectal cancers developed in 1437 patients: 267 in irradiated sites, 686 in potentially irradiated sites, and 484 in nonirradiated sites. Radiation was independently associated with development of cancer over time in irradiated sites but not in the remainder of the colon. The adjusted hazards ratio for development of rectal cancer was 1.7 for the radiation group, compared with the surgery-only group (95% CI: 1.4-2.2)., CONCLUSIONS: We noted a significant increase in development of rectal cancer after radiation for prostate cancer. Radiation had no effect on development of cancer in the remainder of the colon, indicating that the effect is specific to directly irradiated tissue.",2005,/,Gastroenterology,128,4,819-24,,,15825064,#5754,Baxter 2005,,
Proportion of second cancers attributable to radiotherapy treatment in adults: a cohort study in the US SEER cancer registries.,"Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy; Curtis, Rochelle E; Kry, Stephen F; Gilbert, Ethel; Lamart, Stephanie; Berg, Christine D; Stovall, Marilyn; Ron, Elaine","BACKGROUND: Improvements in cancer survival have made the long-term risks from treatments more important, including the risk of developing a second cancer after radiotherapy. We aimed to estimate the proportion of second cancers attributable to radiotherapy in adults with data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registries., METHODS: We used nine of the SEER registries to systematically analyse 15 cancer sites that are routinely treated with radiotherapy (oral and pharynx, salivary gland, rectum, anus, larynx, lung, soft tissue, female breast, cervix, endometrial, prostate, testes, eye and orbit, brain and CNS, and thyroid). The cohort we studied was composed of patients aged 20 years or older who were diagnosed with a first primary invasive solid cancer reported in the SEER registries between Jan 1, 1973, and Dec 31, 2002. Relative risks (RRs) for second cancer in patients treated with radiotherapy versus patients not treated with radiotherapy were estimated with Poisson regression adjusted for age, stage, and other potential confounders., FINDINGS: 647,672 cancer patients who were 5-year survivors were followed up for a mean 12 years (SD 4.5, range 5-34); 60,271 (9%) developed a second solid cancer. For each of the first cancer sites the RR of developing a second cancer associated with radiotherapy exceeded 1, and varied from 1.08 (95% CI 0.79-1.46) after cancers of the eye and orbit to 1.43 (1.13-1.84) after cancer of the testes. In general, the RR was highest for organs that typically received greater than 5 Gy, decreased with increasing age at diagnosis, and increased with time since diagnosis. We estimated a total of 3266 (2862-3670) excess second solid cancers that could be related to radiotherapy, that is 8% (7-9) of the total in all radiotherapy patients (>=1 year survivors) and five excess cancers per 1000 patients treated with radiotherapy by 15 years after diagnosis., INTERPRETATION: A relatively small proportion of second cancers are related to radiotherapy in adults, suggesting that most are due to other factors, such as lifestyle or genetics., FUNDING: US National Cancer Institute.

"The rate of secondary malignancies after radical prostatectomy versus external beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: a population-based study on 17,845 patients.","Bhojani, Naeem; Capitanio, Umberto; Suardi, Nazareno; Jeldres, Claudio; Isbarn, Hendrik; Shariat, Shahrokh F; Graefen, Markus; Arjane, Philippe; Duclos, Alain; Lattouf, Jean-Baptiste; Saad, Fred; Valiquette, Luc; Montorsi, Francesco; Perrotte, Paul; Karakiewicz, Pierre I","PURPOSE: External-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) may predispose to secondary malignancies that include bladder cancer (BCa), rectal cancer (RCa), and lung cancer (LCa). We tested this hypothesis in a large French Canadian population-based cohort of prostate cancer patients., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Overall, 8,455 radical prostatectomy (RP) and 9,390 EBRT patients treated between 1983 and 2003 were assessed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Three endpoints were examined: (1) diagnosis of secondary BCa, (2) LCa, or (3) RCa. Covariates included age, Charlson comorbidity index, and year of treatment., RESULTS: In multivariable analyses that relied on incident cases diagnosed 60 months or later after RP or EBRT, the rates of BCa (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4; p = 0.02), LCa (HR, 2.0; p = 0.004), and RCa (HR 2.1; p <0.001) were significantly higher in the EBRT group. When incident cases diagnosed 120 months or later after RP or EBRT were considered, only the rates of RCa (hazard ratio 2.2; p = 0.003) were significantly higher in the EBRT group. In both analyses, the absolute differences in incident rates ranged from 0.7 to 5.2% and the number needed to harm (where harm equaled secondary malignancies) ranged from 111 to 19, if EBRT was used instead of RP., CONCLUSIONS: EBRT may predispose to clinically meaningfully higher rates of secondary BCa, LCa and RCa. These rates should be included in informed consent consideration. Crown Copyright 2010. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Bladder cancer incidence and risk factors in men with prostate cancer: results from Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor.,"Boorjian, Stephen; Cowan, Janet E; Konety, Badrinath R; DuChane, Janeen; Tewari, Ashutosh; Carroll, Peter R; Kane, Christopher J","PURPOSE: We evaluated a large disease registry to determine the incidence of bladder cancer in patients with prostate cancer and investigate whether the type of treatment for prostate cancer increased the risk of bladder cancer., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the CaPSURE disease registry for men diagnosed with prostate cancer plus bladder cancer between 1989 and 2003. Demographics, comorbidities and prostate cancer treatment modalities were compared in patients with and without bladder cancer. A backward stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to predict bladder cancer onset after treatment for prostate cancer in patients who had bladder cancer 30 days or greater after prostate cancer treatment., RESULTS: Of 9,780 patients from CaPSURE 143 (1.46%) also had bladder cancer. Patients with bladder cancer and prostate cancer were older (p<0.01) and more likely to be white (p=0.03), and they had lower levels of income (p<0.01) and education (p=0.04) than patients with prostate cancer only. Comorbidities did not differ between patients with and without bladder cancer. Patients treated with radical prostatectomy were approximately half as likely to have posttreatment bladder cancer as patients who underwent radiation therapy (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.89). Patients who smoked had an independent increase in the risk of bladder cancer (HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.09-3.97), while smokers treated with radiation therapy were at almost 4-fold risk for bladder cancer (HR 3.65, 95% CI 1.45-9.16)., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of bladder cancer in patients with prostate cancer was 1.5%.

Second malignancies in prostate carcinoma patients after radiotherapy compared with surgery.,"Brenner, D J; Curtis, R E; Hall, E J; Ron, E","BACKGROUND: In the treatment of prostate carcinoma, radiotherapy and surgery are common choices of comparable efficacy; thus a realistic comparison of the potential long term sequelae, such as the risk of second malignancy, may be of relevance to treatment choice., METHODS: Data regarding the rate of incidence from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program cancer registry (1973-1993) were used to compare directly second malignancy risks in 51,584 men with prostate carcinoma who received radiotherapy (3549 of whom developed second malignancies) with 70,539 men who underwent surgery without radiotherapy (5055 of whom developed second malignancies). Data were stratified by latency period, age at diagnosis, and site of the second malignancy. Directly comparing the risks in the radiotherapy group with those in the surgery group largely avoids problems associated with underreporting second malignancies., RESULTS: Radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma was associated with a small, statistically significant increase in the risk of solid tumors (6%; P = 0.02) relative to treatment with surgery. Among patients who survived for >/= 5 years, the increased relative risk reached 15%, and was 34% for patients surviving >/= 10 years. The most significant contributors to the increased risk in the irradiated group were carcinomas of the bladder, rectum, and lung, and sarcomas within the treatment field. No significant increase in rates of leukemia was noted., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma was associated with a statistically significant, although fairly small, enhancement in the risk of second solid tumors, particularly for long term survivors. The pattern of excess second malignancies among men treated with radiotherapy was consistent with radiobiologic principles in terms of site, dose, and latency. In absolute terms, the estimated risk of developing a radiation-associated second malignancy was 1 in 290 for all prostate carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy, increasing to 1 in 70 for long term survivors (>/= 10 years). Improvements in radiotherapeutic techniques, along with diagnosis at younger ages and earlier stages, are resulting in longer survival times for patients with prostate carcinoma. Because of the long latency period for radiation-induced tumors, this may result in radiation-related second malignancy risk becoming a more significant issue.

Risk of second primary tumors in men diagnosed with prostate cancer: a population-based cohort study.,"Davis, Elizabeth J; Beebe-Dimmer, Jennifer L; Yee, Cecilia L; Cooney, Kathleen A","BACKGROUND: The survival of men diagnosed with prostate cancer has improved over time, and the current 10-year relative survival rate is 99.7%. The long survival of patients with this common cancer raises questions about the risk of a second primary cancer and the need for continued surveillance., METHODS: A population-based cohort of 441,504 men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1992 and 2010 was identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER) data (SEER13). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated as an estimate of the risk of a second primary malignancy based on the incidence in the general population., RESULTS: Prostate cancer survivors had a lower risk of being diagnosed with another cancer overall compared with the US population (SIR = 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.61). The risks of leukemia and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, lung and bronchus, and larynx were significantly lower. Conversely, these patients had a greater risk of bladder, kidney, and endocrine and soft tissue cancers. Men who received treatment with radiation therapy (external-beam radiation therapy) had long-term increases in their risk of bladder cancer (SIR = 1.42) and rectal cancer (SIR = 1.70) risk compared with who did not receive radiation (SIRbladder = 0.76; SIRrectal = 0.74). There were significant racial differences in the risk of being diagnosed with a second primary cancer, and the magnitude and direction of these risks depended on tumor type., CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer survivors remain at risk of subsequent malignancies, and race and treatment choice important determinants of long-term risk.

Prostate brachytherapy and second primary cancer risk: a competitive risk analysis.,"Hinnen, Karel A; Schaapveld, Michael; van Vulpen, Marco; Battermann, Jan J; van der Poel, Henk; van Oort, Inge M; van Roermund, Joep G H; Monninkhof, Evelyn M","PURPOSE: To assess the risk of second primary cancer (SPC) after [(125)I]iodine prostate cancer brachytherapy compared with prostatectomy and the general population., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cohort consisting of 1,888 patients with prostate cancer who received monotherapy with brachytherapy (n = 1,187; 63%) or prostatectomy (n = 701; 37%), SPC incidences were retrieved by linkage with the Dutch Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence rates (SIRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were calculated for comparison., RESULTS: A total of 223 patients were diagnosed with SPC, 136 (11%) after brachytherapy and 87 (12%) after prostatectomy, with a median follow-up of 7.5 years. The SIR for all malignancies, bladder cancer, and rectal cancer were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.12), 1.69 (95% CI, 0.98 to 2.70), and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.41 to 1.72) for brachytherapy and 1.04 (95% CI, 0.83 to 2.28), 1.82 (95% CI, 0.87 to 3.35), and 1.50 (95% CI, 0.68 to 2.85) for prostatectomy, respectively. Bladder SPC risk was significantly increased after brachytherapy for patients age 60 years or younger (SIR, 5.84; 95% CI, 2.14 to 12.71; AER, 24.03) and in the first 4 years of follow-up (SIR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.94; AER, 12.24). Adjusted for age, the hazard ratio (brachytherapy v prostatectomy) for all SPCs combined was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.64 to 1.18)., CONCLUSION: Overall, we found no difference in SPC incidence between patients with prostate cancer treated with prostatectomy or brachytherapy. Furthermore, no increased tumor incidence was found compared with the general population. We observed a higher than expected incidence of bladder SPC after brachytherapy in the first 4 years of follow-up, probably resulting from lead time or screening bias.

Analysis of second malignancies after modern radiotherapy versus prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.,"Huang, Jiayi; Kestin, Larry L; Ye, Hong; Wallace, Michelle; Martinez, Alvaro A; Vicini, Frank A","PURPOSE: To clarify the risk of developing second primary cancers (SPCs) after radiotherapy (RT) versus prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer (PCa) in the modern era., METHODS: The RT cohort consisted of 2120 patients matched on a 1:1 basis with surgical patients according to age and follow-up time. RT techniques consisted of conventional or two-dimensional RT (2DRT, 36%), three-dimensional conformal RT and/or intensity modulated RT (3DCRT/IMRT, 29%), brachytherapy (BT, 16%), and a combination of 2DRT and BT (BT boost, 19%)., RESULTS: The overall SPC risk was not significantly different between the matched-pair (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.94-1.39), but the risk became significant >5years or >10years after RT (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.36-2.55; HR 4.94, 95% CI 2.18-11.2, respectively). The most significant sites of increased risk were bladder, lymphoproliferative, and sarcoma. Of the different RT techniques, only 2DRT was associated with a significantly higher risk (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.32-2.35), but not BT boost (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50-1.38), 3DCRT/IMRT (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.55-1.21), or BT (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28-1.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-related SPC risk varies depending on the RT technique and may be reduced by using BT, BT boost, or 3DCRT/IMRT.

Association of colorectal cancer and prostate cancer and impact of radiation therapy.,"Huo, Dezheng; Hetzel, Jeremy T; Roy, Hemant; Rubin, David T","To quantify the risk of prostate cancer after colorectal cancer and the risk of colorectal cancer after prostate cancer and to examine the impact of radiation therapy on subsequent cancer risk, we conducted retrospective cohort studies using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program from 1973 to 2005. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated, adjusting for age, ethnicity, and calendar year. The subsequent risk of developing a prostate cancer was significantly elevated in patients diagnosed with colon cancer before age 50 years (SIR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18-1.60). The risk of subsequent prostate cancer was decreased for men with rectal cancer who received radiation therapy (SIR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.52-0.63). Interestingly, this beneficial effect of radiation therapy was only observed in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) era (1988+). In addition, the prostate cancer cases developed in the radiation therapy group tended to have higher-grade, later-stage tumors, higher PSA levels, and worse survival than those developed in the nonradiation therapy group. In the cohort of prostate cancer patients, the risk of colon cancer was elevated in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 50 years (SIR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.03-2.20). In conclusion, a diagnosis of colon or prostate cancer in men of younger ages may be an indication for screening of prostate or colon cancer, respectively. The decreased prostate cancer risk in men who received radiation therapy for rectal cancer may be related to the use of PSA for prostate cancer screening or the cure of occult prostate cancer.",2009,/,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",18,7,1979-85,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-0241,19531678,#2996,Huo 2009,,
Radiation therapy for prostate cancer increases the risk of subsequent rectal cancer.,"Margel, David; Baniel, Jack; Wasserberg, Nir; Bar-Chana, Micha; Yossepowitch, Ofer","PURPOSE: To assess whether radiation therapy for prostate cancer (PCa) increases the risk of metachronous rectal cancer (RCa) and compare outcomes of RCa after radiation therapy and surgery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Israel Cancer Registry was queried to identify patients with PCa and RCa diagnosed between 1982 and 2005. The age adjusted standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of RCa was defined as the ratio between the observed and expected (calculated) RCa cases and compared among the following: overall Israeli male population, patients with PCa treated with radiation therapy, patients with PCa treated surgically. The medical records of men diagnosed with RCa were reviewed and clinical characteristics retrieved., RESULTS: Of 29,593 men diagnosed with PCa, 2163 were treated with radiation therapy, 6762 were treated surgically and 20,068 patients were treated with either primary androgen deprivation therapy or offered watchful waiting. Of the entire study cohort, 194 (0.65%) patients were diagnosed with subsequent RCa. Compared to the overall male population and stratified by treatment modality, the risk of developing RCa after radiation therapy was significantly increased (SIR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.2-2.5), whereas it was not increased in those managed by surgery (SIR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.85-1.65). RCa after radiation therapy was diagnosed at a more advanced stage, translating into inferior disease specific survival., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to men diagnosed with PCa managed by surgery, we observed an increased risk of RCa in patients treated with radiation therapy.

Cancer incidence after localized therapy for prostate cancer.,"Moon, Kihyuck; Stukenborg, George J; Keim, Jessica; Theodorescu, Dan","BACKGROUND: Second cancers may occur in patients who have undergone radiation therapy. The risk for these adverse events after therapy is uncertain. In this study, the authors examined the size and significance of the observed association between occurrences of secondary cancers 5 years after radiotherapy in a large population of men with incident prostate cancer., METHODS: Men with incident prostate cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry and were distinguished by the type of treatment received, tumor stage, tumor grade, and age at diagnosis. SEER data also were used to identify occurrences of secondary cancer beginning 5 years after the date patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds of the subsequent occurrence of other cancers associated with types of radiation therapy received and was adjusted for the type of surgery, tumor grade, stage, and patient age., RESULTS: Compared with men who received no prostate cancer-directed radiation, men who received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) as their only form of radiation therapy had statistically significant increased odds of developing secondary cancers at several sites potentially related to radiation therapy, including the bladder (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.44-1.84) and rectum (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.29-1.99). Men who received EBRT also had statistically significant higher odds of developing secondary cancers at sites in the upper body and other areas not potentially related to radiation therapy, including the cecum (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-1.70), transverse colon (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30-2.63), brain (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.22-2.75), stomach (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.75), melanoma (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.53), and lung and bronchus (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37) compared with the odds among men who received no radiation therapy. Men who received radiation therapy in the form of radioactive implants or isotopes, either in isolation or combined with beam radiation, did not have significantly different odds of secondary cancer occurring at any of the 20 most common sites., CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received with EBRT had significantly higher odds of developing second cancers both overall and in the areas that were exposed to radiation. It is noteworthy that, to the authors' knowledge, this report shows for the first time that, despite the higher doses of radiation delivered, patients who received radioactive implants had the lowest odds of developing second cancers.",2006,/,Cancer,107,5,991-8,,,16878323,#3122,Moon 2006,,
Incidence of complications other than urinary incontinence or erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a population-based cohort study.,"Nam, Robert K; Cheung, Patrick; Herschorn, Sender; Saskin, Refik; Su, Jiandong; Klotz, Laurence H; Chang, Michelle; Kulkarni, Girish S; Lee, Yuna; Kodama, Ronald T; Narod, Steven A","BACKGROUND: Studies of complications resulting from surgery or radiotherapy for prostate cancer have mainly focused on incontinence and erectile dysfunction. We aimed to assess other important complications associated with these treatments for prostate cancer., METHODS: We did a population-based retrospective cohort study, in which we used administrative hospital data, physician billing codes, and cancer registry data for men who underwent either surgery or radiotherapy alone for prostate cancer between 2002 and 2009 in Ontario, Canada. We measured the 5-year cumulative incidence of five treatment-related complication endpoints: hospital admissions; urological, rectal, or anal procedures; open surgical procedures; and secondary malignancies., FINDINGS: In the 32 465 patients included in the study, the 5-year cumulative incidence of admission to hospital for a treatment-related complication was 22.2% (95% CI 21.7-22.7), but was 2.4% (2.2-2.6) for patients whose length of stay was longer than 1 day. The 5-year cumulative incidence of needing a urological procedure was 32.0% (95% CI 31.4-32.5), that of a rectal or anal procedure was 13.7% (13.3-14.1), and that of an open surgical procedure was 0.9% (0.8-1.1). The 5-year cumulative incidence of a second primary malignancy was 3.0% (2.6-3.5). These risks were significantly higher than were those of 32 465 matched controls with no history of prostate cancer. Older age and comorbidity at the time of index treatment were important predictors for a complication in all outcome categories, but the type of treatment received was the strongest predictor for complications. Patients who were given radiotherapy had higher incidence of complications for hospital admissions, rectal or anal procedures, open surgical procedures, and secondary malignancies at 5 years than did those who underwent surgery (adjusted hazard ratios 2.08-10.8, p<0.0001). However, the number of urological procedures was lower in the radiotherapy than in the surgery group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.63-0.69; p<0.0001) INTERPRETATION: Complications after prostate cancer treatment are frequent and dependent on age, comorbidity, and the type of treatment. Patients and physicians should be aware of these risks when choosing treatment for prostate cancer, and should balance them with the clinical effectiveness of each therapy., FUNDING: Ajmera Family Chair in Urologic Oncology.

Radiation therapy for prostate cancer increases subsequent risk of bladder and rectal cancer: a population based cohort study.,"Nieder, Alan M; Porter, Michael P; Soloway, Mark S","PURPOSE: Pre-prostate specific antigen era series demonstrated an increased risk of bladder cancer and rectal cancer in men who received radiotherapy for prostate cancer. We estimated the risk of secondary bladder cancer and rectal cancer after prostate radiotherapy using a contemporary population based cohort., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 243,082 men in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database who underwent radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for prostate cancer between 1988 and 2003. We estimated the incidence rate, standardized incidence ratio and age adjusted incidence rate ratio of subsequent bladder cancer and rectal cancer associated with radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and a combination of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy., RESULTS: The relative risk of bladder cancer developing after external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy compared to radical prostatectomy was 1.88, 1.52 and 1.85, respectively. Compared to the general United States population the standardized incidence ratio for bladder cancer developing after radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy was 0.99, 1.42, 1.10 and 1.39, respectively. The relative risk of rectal cancer developing after external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy compared to radical prostatectomy was 1.26, 1.08 and 1.21, respectively. The standardized incidence ratio for rectal cancer developing after radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy was 0.91, 0.99, 0.68 and 0.86, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Men who receive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer have an increased risk of bladder cancer compared to patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and compared to the general population. The risk of rectal cancer is increased in patients who receive external beam radiotherapy compared to radical prostatectomy. Patients should be counseled appropriately regarding these risks.",2008,/,The Journal of urology,180,5,05-Oct,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2008.07.038,18801517,#3030,Nieder 2008,,
"The risk of second malignancy in men with prostate cancer treated with or without radiation in British Columbia, 1984-2000.","Pickles, Tom; Phillips, Norm","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To describe the risk of second malignancy following a diagnosis of prostate cancer, in British Columbia (BC), Canada. To ascertain whether that risk changed with the use of radiation therapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: All invasive cases of prostate cancer diagnosed from 1984 through to 2000 were retrieved from the BC Tumor Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated from observed and expected numbers as a percentage. Patients were divided into those who received high-dose radiation therapy (>/=45 Gy, RT group) and those not treated with radiation (non-RT group)., RESULTS: Overall there was no significant difference between observed and expected second cancer rates, SIR=100 (RT group, N=101; non-RT group, N=98, P=n.s.). Individual tumour sites at significantly increased risk (P<0.01) included bladder (non-RT group, SIR=132), colo-rectal (RT group, SIR=121), pleura (RT group, SIR=228). Other sites of possible significance (P<0.05) include sarcoma (RT group, SIR=170) and testis (non-RT group, SIR=282)., CONCLUSIONS: Increased rates of bladder and testis cancers in the non-RT group are likely to be due to increased urologist surveillance and the use of therapeutic orchiectomy. Increased rates of colorectal cancer in those treated with radiation may be either due to surveillance or treatment. Increases in sarcomas in the RT group are probably treatment-related. Overall the increased second cancer risk for those undergoing radiation therapy was 1 in 220.",2002,/,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,65,3,145-51,,,12464442,#3239,Pickles 2002,,
Increasing age and treatment modality are predictors for subsequent diagnosis of bladder cancer following prostate cancer diagnosis.,"Singh, Anurag K; Mashtare, Terry L; McCloskey, Susan A; Seixas-Mikelus, Stefanie A; Kim, Hyung L; May, Kilian Salerno","PURPOSE: To determine the effect of prostate cancer therapy (surgery or external beam irradiation, or both or none) on the actuarial incidence of subsequent bladder cancer., METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry from 1973 to 2005 was analyzed. Treatment was stratified as radiotherapy, surgery, both surgery and adjuvant radiation, and neither modality. Brachytherapy was excluded., RESULTS: In all, 555,337 prostate carcinoma patients were identified; 124,141 patients were irradiated; 235,341 patients were treated surgically; 32,744 patients had both surgery and radiation; and 163,111 patients received neither modality. Bladder cancers were diagnosed in: 1,836 (1.48%) men who were irradiated (mean age, 69.4 years), 2,753 (1.09%) men who were treated surgically (mean age, 66.9 years); 683 (2.09%) men who received both modalities (mean age, 67.4 years), and 1,603 (0.98%) men who were treated with neither modality (mean age, 71.8 years). In each treatment cohort, Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that increasing age (by decade) was a significant predictor of developing bladder cancer (p < 0.0001). Incidence of bladder cancer was significantly different for either radiation or surgery alone versus no treatment, radiation versus surgery alone, and both surgery and radiation versus either modality alone (p < 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, age and irradiation were highly significant predictors of being diagnosed with bladder cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Following prostate cancer, increasing age and irradiation were highly significant predictors of being diagnosed with bladder cancer. While use of radiation increased the risk of bladder cancer compared to surgery alone or no treatment, the overall incidence of subsequent bladder cancer remained low.

"Incidence of second malignancies for prostate cancer in the canton of Zurich, 1980-2010",Van Hemelrijck M.; Feller A.; Gormo H.; Korol D.; Valeri F.; Dehler S.; Rohrmann S. ,"Introduction and Objectives: The number of men living with prostate cancer (PCa) is growing rapidly. It is of public health importance to assess risk of second primary cancers in these men, especially since it is thought that PCa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of second primary tumours. Moreover, this could lead to identification of potential underlying etiological mechanisms. Material(s) and Method(s): We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for second primary tumours comparing men diagnosed with PCa between 1980 and 2010 in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (n = 20,559), and the general male population in the Canton. Result(s): A total of 1,718 men developed a second primary tumour after PCa diagnosis with lung and colon cancer being the most common, 15 and 13% respectively. The majority of men diagnosed with PCa were over 65 years old (76%) and had a grade II tumour (45%). Overall, there was an increased risk of a second primary tumour among men with PCa, compared to the general population (SIR: 1.11 (95% CI: 1.06-1.17)). Site-specific SIRs varied from 1.19 (1.05-1.34) to 2.89 (2.62-4.77) for lung and thyroid cancer, respectively. When stratified by treatment, the highest SIR was observed for thyroid cancer and (3.57 (1.30-7.76)) when undergoing surgery, whereas liver cancer was most common when treated with radiotherapy (3.21 (1.54-5.90) and kidney bladder was most prevalent for those on hormonal treatment (3.15 (1.93- 4.87). Stratification by tumour grade showed an SIR for all cancers of 1.28 (1.17- 1.40) for men with a grade I tumour, 1.10 (1.02-1.18) for men with a grade II tumour, and 1.03 (0.91-1.15) for those with a grade III/IV tumour. For PCas diagnosed prior to 1995, the SIR for a second primary tumour was 1.05 (0.98-1.12), whereas it was 1.17 (1.10-1.25) for those diagnosed from 1995 onwards. To assess diagnostic activity we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding those PCa men with follow-up <6 months, which resulted in a SIR for a second primary tumour of 1.03 (0.97-1.08). Statistically significant SIRs >1.5 were observed for cancer of oesophagus, colon, gallbladder, pancreas, bladder, melanoma, brain, thyroid, non-hodgkin, and leukemia. Conclusion(s): In the Canton of Zurich, there was an increased risk of second primary cancers among men with PCa compared to the general population. Increased diagnostic activity after PCa diagnosis may partly explain increased risks within the first years of diagnosis, but our time-stratified analyses indicated that these increased risks remained and even increased over time. These observations suggest a need for careful management of prostate cancer survivors.",2014,/,European Journal of Cancer,50,SUPPL. 5,S230-S231,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0959-8049%2814%2950838-6,71548463,#3813,VanHemelrijck 2014,,
"Secondary cancers after intensity-modulated radiotherapy, brachytherapy and radical prostatectomy for the treatment of prostate cancer: incidence and cause-specific survival outcomes according to the initial treatment intervention.","Zelefsky, Michael J; Pei, Xin; Teslova, Tatiana; Kuk, Deborah; Magsanoc, Juan Martin; Kollmeier, Marisa; Cox, Brett; Zhang, Zhigang","UNLABELLED: Study Type--Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence 4 What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Radiation Therapy for prostate cancer can increase the risk for the development of second cancers after treatment. This study highlights the fact that such second cancers within the pelvis do occur but are not as common as previously reported. In this report we also note that even among patients who develop second cancers, if detected earlier, the majority are alive 5 years after the diagnosis., OBJECTIVE: * To report on the incidence of secondary malignancy (SM) development after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy (BT) for prostate cancer and to compare this with a cohort contemporaneously treated with radical prostatectomy (RP)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: * Between 1998 and 2001, 2658 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with RP (n = 1348), EBRT (n = 897) or BT (n = 413). * Using the RP cohort as a control we compared the incidence of SMs, such as rectal or bladder cancers noted within the pelvis, and the incidence of extrapelvic SMs., RESULTS: * The 10-year SM-free survival for the RP, BT and EBRT cohorts were 89%, 87%, and 83%, respectively (RP vs EBRT, P = 0.002; RP vs BT, P = 0.37). * The 10-year likelihoods for bladder or colorectal cancer SM development in the RP, BT and EBRT groups were 3%, 2% and 4%, respectively (P = 0.29). * Multivariate analysis of predictors for development of all SMs showed that older age (P = 0.01) and history of smoking (P < 0.001) were significant predictors for the development of a SM, while treatment intervention was not found to be a significant variable. * Among 243 patients who developed a SM, the 5-year likelihood of SM-related mortality among patients with SMs in the EBRT and BT groups was 43.7% and 15.6%, respectively, compared with 26.3% in the RP cohort; P = 0.052)., CONCLUSIONS: * The incidence of SM after radiotherapy was not significantly different from that after RP when adjusted for patient age and smoking history. * The incidence of bladder and rectal cancers was low for both EBRT- and BT-treated patients. * Among patients who developed a SM, the likelihood of mortality related to the SM was not significantly different among the treatment cohorts.

Increased risk of colon cancer after external radiation therapy for prostate cancer.,"Rapiti, Elisabetta; Fioretta, Gerald; Verkooijen, Helena M; Zanetti, Roberto; Schmidlin, Franz; Shubert, Hyma; Merglen, Arnaud; Miralbell, Raymond; Bouchardy, Christine","Radiotherapy can induce second cancers. Controversies still exist regarding the risk of second malignancies after irradiation for prostate cancer. We evaluated the risk of developing colon and rectum cancers after prostate cancer in irradiated and nonirradiated patients. Using data from the population-based Geneva cancer registry, we included in the study all men with prostate cancer diagnosed between 1980 and 1998 who survived at least 5 years after diagnosis. Of the 1,134 patients, 264 were treated with external radiotherapy. Patients were followed for occurrence of colorectal cancer up to 31 December, 2003. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) using incidence rates for the general population to obtain the expected cancer incidence. The cohort yielded to 3,798 person-years. At the end of follow-up 19 patients had developed a colorectal cancer. Among irradiated patients the SIR for colorectal cancer was 3.4 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.7-6.0). Compared to the general population, the risk was significantly higher for colon cancer (SIR = 4.0, 95% CI: 1.8-7.6), but not for rectal cancer (SIR = 2.0, 95% CI: 0.2-7.2). The risk of colon cancer was increased in the period of 5-9 years after diagnosis (SIR = 4.7, 95% CI: 2.0-9.2). The overall SIR of secondary cancer in patients treated with radiotherapy was 1.35 (p = 0.056). Nonirradiated patients did not have any increased risk of rectal or colon cancer. This study shows a significant increase of colon but not rectum cancer after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.
