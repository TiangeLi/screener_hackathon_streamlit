The pattern of excess second malignancies among men treated with radiotherapy was consistent with radiobiologic principles in terms of site, dose, and latency. In absolute terms, the estimated risk of developing a radiation-associated second malignancy was 1 in 290 for all prostate carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy, increasing to 1 in 70 for long term survivors (>/= 10 years). Improvements in radiotherapeutic techniques, along with diagnosis at younger ages and earlier stages, are resulting in longer survival times for patients with prostate carcinoma. Because of the long latency period for radiation-induced tumors, this may result in radiation-related second malignancy risk becoming a more significant issue.\n",

Overall, there was an increased risk of a second primary tumour among men with PCa, compared to the general population (SIR: 1.11 (95% CI: 1.06-1.17)). Site-specific SIRs varied from 1.19 (1.05-1.34) for lung cancer to 2.89 (2.62-4.77) for thyroid cancer. Highest SIR for thyroid cancer was 3.57 (1.30-7.76) when undergoing surgery, liver cancer was most common with radiotherapy (3.21 (1.54-5.90)), and kidney bladder was most prevalent for hormonal treatment (3.15 (1.93-4.87)). SIR for all cancers was 1.28 (1.17-1.40) for grade I, 1.10 (1.02-1.18) for grade II, and 1.03 (0.91-1.15) for grade III/IV tumours. SIR for PCAs diagnosed prior to 1995 was 1.05 (0.98-1.12) and 1.17 (1.10-1.25) for those diagnosed from 1995 onwards. SIR for second primary tumour was 1.03 (0.97-1.08) when excluding PCa men with follow-up <6 months.
