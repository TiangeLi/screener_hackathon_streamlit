Proportion of second cancers attributable to radiotherapy treatment in adults: a cohort study in the US SEER cancer registries.,"Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy; Curtis, Rochelle E; Kry, Stephen F; Gilbert, Ethel; Lamart, Stephanie; Berg, Christine D; Stovall, Marilyn; Ron, Elaine","BACKGROUND: Improvements in cancer survival have made the long-term risks from treatments more important, including the risk of developing a second cancer after radiotherapy. We aimed to estimate the proportion of second cancers attributable to radiotherapy in adults with data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registries., METHODS: We used nine of the SEER registries to systematically analyse 15 cancer sites that are routinely treated with radiotherapy (oral and pharynx, salivary gland, rectum, anus, larynx, lung, soft tissue, female breast, cervix, endometrial, prostate, testes, eye and orbit, brain and CNS, and thyroid). The cohort we studied was composed of patients aged 20 years or older who were diagnosed with a first primary invasive solid cancer reported in the SEER registries between Jan 1, 1973, and Dec 31, 2002. Relative risks (RRs) for second cancer in patients treated with radiotherapy versus patients not treated with radiotherapy were estimated with Poisson regression adjusted for age, stage, and other potential confounders., FINDINGS: 647,672 cancer patients who were 5-year survivors were followed up for a mean 12 years (SD 4.5, range 5-34); 60,271 (9%) developed a second solid cancer. For each of the first cancer sites the RR of developing a second cancer associated with radiotherapy exceeded 1, and varied from 1.08 (95% CI 0.79-1.46) after cancers of the eye and orbit to 1.43 (1.13-1.84) after cancer of the testes. In general, the RR was highest for organs that typically received greater than 5 Gy, decreased with increasing age at diagnosis, and increased with time since diagnosis. We estimated a total of 3266 (2862-3670) excess second solid cancers that could be related to radiotherapy, that is 8% (7-9) of the total in all radiotherapy patients (>=1 year survivors) and five excess cancers per 1000 patients treated with radiotherapy by 15 years after diagnosis., INTERPRETATION: A relatively small proportion of second cancers are related to radiotherapy in adults, suggesting that most are due to other factors, such as lifestyle or genetics., FUNDING: US National Cancer Institute.

Higher Than Expected Association of Clinical Prostate and Bladder Cancers,Singh A.; Kinoshita Y.; Rovito Jr. P.M.; Landas S.; Silberstein J.; Nsouli I.; Wang C.Y.; Haas G.P. ,"Purpose: In this study we evaluated the risk of a second malignancy of the bladder or prostate in patients with a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) or urothelial cancer (TCC). Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed all cases of PCa and TCC diagnosed between January 1996 and June 2003. Only PCa diagnosed due to abnormal digital rectal examination or increased prostate specific antigen were included. All patients with TCC presented with hematuria or irritative voiding symptoms and the diagnoses were confirmed with a tissue diagnosis. The incidence of lung, colon and renal cancers was also analyzed. Result(s): A total of 816 men were diagnosed with PCa and/or TCC. Of 673 men initially diagnosed with PCa 21 had TCC. Of 149 men initially diagnosed with TCC 18 had PCa. Average age at PCa and TCC diagnosis +/- SD was 68.2 +/- 7.9 and 68.2 +/- 10.4 years, respectively. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of TCC in patients with PCa (SIR 4.31, 95% CI 2.411 to 7.110) and of PCa in patients with TCC (SIR 3.83, 95% CI 1.911 to 6.858) was significantly increased. There was no statistical significant difference in SIR for TCC in men with or without radiotherapy. SIR for lung, renal or colon cancer was not significantly different from what was expected. Conclusion(s): Patients with PCa have higher incidence of bladder cancer and those with bladder cancer have a higher incidence of PCa. This study has clinical implications in the care of these patients and it may stimulate research interest that may identify common pathways of carcinogenesis. © 2008 American Urological Association.",2008,/,Journal of Urology,179,5 SUPPL.,S2-S5,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2008.03.130,351483910,#5231,Singh 2008,,
Surgery for rectal cancer after high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer: is sphincter preservation relevant?.,"Buscail, E; Blondeau, V; Adam, J-P; Pontallier, A; Laurent, C; Rullier, E; Denost, Q","AIM: The feasibility and outcome of sphincter-saving resection for rectal cancer were assessed in patients previously treated by high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer., METHOD: Between 2000 and 2012, 1066 patients underwent rectal excision for rectal cancer. Of these, 236 were treated by conventional radiotherapy (45 Gy) and sphincter-saving resection (Group A) and 12 were treated by external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer (70 Gy) and sphincter-saving resection (Group B) of whom five had a metachronous and seven a synchronous cancer. The end-points were surgical morbidity, pelvic sepsis, reoperation and definitive stoma., RESULTS: Tumour characteristics were similar in both groups. Surgical morbidity (67% vs 25%, P = 0.004), anastomotic leakage (50% vs 10%, P = 0.001, and reoperation (50% vs 17%, P = 0.011) were significantly higher in Group B. Multivariate analyses showed that EBRT for prostate cancer was the only independent factor for anastomotic leakage (OR = 5.12; 95% CI 1.45-18.08; P = 0.011) and definitive stoma (OR = 10.56; 95% CI 3.02-39.92; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: High-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases morbidity from rectal surgery and the risk of a permanent stoma. This suggests that a delayed coloanal anastomosis or a Hartmann procedure should be proposed as an alternative to low anterior resection in this population.

Incidence of primary cancers and intracranial tumour recurrences in GH-treated and untreated adult hypopituitary patients: analyses from the Hypopituitary Control and Complications Study.,"Child, Christopher J; Conroy, Daniel; Zimmermann, Alan G; Woodmansee, Whitney W; Erfurth, Eva Marie; Robison, Leslie L","OBJECTIVE: Speculation remains that GH treatment is associated with increased neoplasia risk. Studies in GH-treated childhood cancer survivors suggested higher rates of second neoplasms, while cancer risk data for GH-treated and untreated hypopituitary adults have been variable. We present primary cancer risk data from the Hypopituitary Control and Complications Study (HypoCCS) with a focus on specific cancers, and assessment of recurrence rates for pituitary adenomas (PA) and craniopharyngiomas (CP)., DESIGN: Incident neoplasms during HypoCCS were evaluated in 8418 GH-treated vs 1268 untreated patients for primary malignancies, 3668 GH-treated vs 720 untreated patients with PA history, and 956 GH-treated vs 102 untreated patients with CP history., METHODS: Using population cancer rates, standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for all primary cancers, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Neoplasm rates in GH-treated vs untreated patients were analysed after propensity score adjustment of baseline treatment group imbalances., RESULTS: During mean follow-up of 4.8 years, 225 primary cancers were identified in GH-treated patients, with SIR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.71-0.93). SIRs (95% CI) for GH-treated patients were 0.59 (0.36-0.90) for breast, 0.80 (0.57-1.10) for prostate, and 0.62 (0.38-0.96) for colorectal cancers. Cancer risk was not statistically different between GH-treated and untreated patients (relative risk (RR)=1.00 (95% CI 0.70-1.41), P=0.98). Adjusted RR for recurrence was 0.91 (0.68-1.22), P=0.53 for PA and 1.32 (0.53-3.31), P=0.55 for CP., CONCLUSIONS: There was no increased risk for all-site cancers: breast, prostate or colorectal primary cancers in GH-treated patients during HypoCCS. GH treatment did not increase the risk of PA and CP recurrences.

Fifteen-year Outcomes Following Conservative Management Among Men Aged 65 Years or Older with Localized Prostate Cancer.,"Lu-Yao, Grace L; Albertsen, Peter C; Moore, Dirk F; Lin, Yong; DiPaola, Robert S; Yao, Siu-Long","BACKGROUND: To understand the threat posed by localized prostate cancer and the potential impact of surgery or radiation, patients and healthcare providers require information on long-term outcomes following conservative management., OBJECTIVE: To describe 15-yr survival outcomes and cancer therapy utilization among men 65 years and older managed conservatively for newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer., DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a population-based cohort study with participants living in predefined geographic areas covered by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. The study includes 31 137 Medicare patients aged >=65 yr diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in 1992-2009 who initially received conservative management (no surgery, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]). All patients were followed until death or December 31, 2009 (for prostate cancer-specific mortality [PCSM]) and December 31, 2011 (for overall mortality)., OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Competing-risk analyses were used to examine PCSM, overall mortality, and utilization of cancer therapies., RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The 15-yr risk of PCSM for men aged 65-74 yr diagnosed with screening-detected prostate cancer was 5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7-8.0%) for T1c Gleason 5-7 and 22% (95% CI 16-35%) for Gleason 8-10 disease. After 15 yr of follow-up, 24% (95% CI 21-27%) of men aged 65-74 yr with screening-detected Gleason 5-7 cancer received ADT. The corresponding result for men with Gleason 8-10 cancer was 38% (95% CI 32-44%). The major study limitations are the lack of data for men aged <65 yr and detailed clinical information associated with secondary cancer therapy., CONCLUSIONS: The 15-yr outcomes following conservative management of newly diagnosed Gleason 5-7 prostate cancer among men aged >=65 yr are excellent. Men with Gleason 8-10 disease managed conservatively face a significant risk of PCSM., PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the long-term survival outcomes for a large group of patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who did not have surgery, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or androgen deprivation therapy in the first 6 mo after cancer diagnosis. We found that the 15-yr disease-specific survival is excellent for men diagnosed with Gleason 5-7 disease. The data support conservative management as a reasonable choice for elderly patients with low-grade localized prostate cancer. Copyright © 2015 European Association of Urology.

Androgen pathway manipulation and survival in patients with lung cancer.,"Harlos, Craig; Musto, Grace; Lambert, Pascal; Ahmed, Rashid; Pitz, Marshall W","The epidemiology of lung cancer differs between men and women. The role of androgens in lung cancer remains unclear. This study was performed to determine if exposure to androgen pathway manipulation (APM) is associated with greater survival in male patients diagnosed with lung cancer. Using a retrospective cohort design, all men diagnosed with lung cancer from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2010 were identified from the population-based Manitoba Cancer Registry and Manitoba Health Administrative Databases. Information from the Drug Program Information Network (DPIN) was used to determine prescriptions filled for antiandrogens, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis with time-varying exposure variables was used to compare survival. A total of 3018 men with lung cancer were identified between 2004 and 2010. Of these, 339 (11.5%) were identified as having used a form of APM. The majority of patients received 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Patients who received APM prior to the diagnosis of lung cancer had no significant difference in survival (HR 0.97, p = 0.69) compared to those who did not. Patients exposed to APM after their diagnosis were found to have a significantly better survival (HR 0.36, p = 0.0007), as were those exposed both before and after diagnosis (HR 0.53, p < 0.0001). In male patients diagnosed with lung cancer, exposure to APM is associated with significantly better survival when compared with no exposure. The association is only seen when some or all of the exposure has occurred after the diagnosis of lung cancer.",2015,/,Hormones & cancer,6,03-Feb,120-7,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12672-015-0218-1,25792547,#2713,Harlos 2015,,
Development and validation of risk prediction algorithms to estimate future risk of common cancers in men and women: prospective cohort study.,"Hippisley-Cox, Julia; Coupland, Carol","OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate a set of clinical risk prediction algorithm to estimate the 10-year risk of 11 common cancers., DESIGN: Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data from 753 QResearch general practices in England. We used 565 practices to develop the scores and 188 for validation., SUBJECTS: 4.96 million patients aged 25-84 years in the derivation cohort; 1.64 million in the validation cohort. Patients were free of the relevant cancer at baseline., METHODS: Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation cohort to derive 10-year risk algorithms. Risk factors considered included age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, previous cancer diagnoses, family history of cancer, relevant comorbidities and medication. Measures of calibration and discrimination in the validation cohort., OUTCOMES: Incident cases of blood, breast, bowel, gastro-oesophageal, lung, oral, ovarian, pancreas, prostate, renal tract and uterine cancers. Cancers were recorded on any one of four linked data sources (general practitioner (GP), mortality, hospital or cancer records)., RESULTS: We identified 228,241 incident cases during follow-up of the 11 types of cancer. Of these 25,444 were blood; 41,315 breast; 32,626 bowel, 12,808 gastro-oesophageal; 32,187 lung; 4811 oral; 6635 ovarian; 7119 pancreatic; 35,256 prostate; 23,091 renal tract; 6949 uterine cancers. The lung cancer algorithm had the best performance with an R(2) of 64.2%; D statistic of 2.74; receiver operating characteristic curve statistic of 0.91 in women. The sensitivity for the top 10% of women at highest risk of lung cancer was 67%. Performance of the algorithms in men was very similar to that for women., CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated a prediction models to quantify absolute risk of 11 common cancers. They can be used to identify patients at high risk of cancers for prevention or further assessment. The algorithms could be integrated into clinical computer systems and used to identify high-risk patients., WEB CALCULATOR: There is a simple web calculator to implement the Qcancer 10 year risk algorithm together with the open source software for download (available at http://qcancer.org/10yr/).

Multiple primary malignancies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.,"Fujita, Shiro; Masago, Katsuhiro; Takeshita, Jumpei; Togashi, Yosuke; Hata, Akito; Kaji, Reiko; Kokubo, Masaki; Katakami, Nobuyuki","OBJECTIVE: Information regarding multiple primary malignancies is important, as it has the potential to clarify etiological factors and may indicate the need to refine patient follow-up to include screening for associated malignancies. Upper aerodigestive tract cancer often develops in patients with smoking-related lung cancer; however, little is known about the frequencies or types of other primary malignancies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without a history of smoking., METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the records of patients examined and/or treated for NSCLC at the Institute of Biomedical Research and Innovation between January 2007 and June 2012. Patients In total, 938 patients, including 599 men (never-smoker/ever-smoker: 35/564) and 339 women (never-smoker/ever-smoker: 236/103), were analyzed., RESULTS: Among the 209 patients (22.3%) with multiple primary malignancies, 151 had a history of smoking and 58 were never-smokers. The most common cancers were gastric (43 cases), colorectal (33 cases), and prostate (29 cases) cancer. Smoking-related cancer was more common in current smokers and ex-smokers for both men and women. Among women with NSCLC, never-smokers were more likely to have thyroid cancer than those with a history of smoking (5.1% vs. 0%, p=0.021)., CONCLUSION: In this study, several differences in malignancies were observed between never-smokers and patients with a history of smoking. Thyroid cancer and NSCLC co-existed in some women without a history of smoking, implicating predisposing factors other than tobacco smoke in the onset of these cancers.",2015,/,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",54,3,325-31,,https://dx.doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.54.2921,25748742,#2715,Fujita 2015,,
"Complications after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for prostate cancer: results of a population-based, propensity score-matched analysis.","Wallis, Christopher J D; Herschorn, Sender; Saskin, Refik; Su, Jiandong; Klotz, Laurence H; Chang, Michelle; Kulkarni, Girish S; Lee, Yuna; Kodama, Ronald T; Narod, Steven A; Nam, Robert K","OBJECTIVE: To assess rates of treatment-related complications after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy monotherapy, using propensity score matching to account for baseline differences between these patient populations., METHODS: On the basis of a population-based study of men undergoing surgery or radiotherapy for prostate cancer in Ontario between 2002 and 2009, we undertook a propensity score-matched analysis including age, comorbidity, and year of treatment to assess treatment-related complication end points. These included hospital admission; urologic, rectal, or anal procedures; open surgeries; and secondary malignancies., RESULTS: From the original cohort of 32,465 patients, 15,870 (48.9%) had surgery and 16,595 (51.1%) had radiation. Propensity score matching produced 8797 pairs (17,594 patients). Among these, when compared with patients treated with surgery, those treated with radiation experienced fewer admissions to hospital (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-0.92) and urologic procedures (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.46-0.53) at year 1 but higher rates at year 3 (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 4.61-6.91 and HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.62-2.13, respectively) and year 5. Although there was no significant difference in open surgeries at year 1, patients undergoing radiotherapy were at higher risk by year 3 (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.23-3.47) and this rose by year 5. Over the study period, patients undergoing radiotherapy experienced more rectal-anal procedures (HR, 2.64; 95% CI, 2.37-2.95) and were diagnosed with more secondary malignancies (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.16-5.14). Direct matching produced similar results., CONCLUSION: From a propensity score-matched analysis, we found that patients undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer had higher rates of long-term complications in all 5 categories studied than patients undergoing surgery.

Mutations were present at high levels in morphologically normal tissue distant from the cancer, reflecting clonal expansions, and the underlying mutational processes at work in morphologically normal tissue were also at work in cancer. Our observations demonstrate the existence of ongoing abnormal mutational processes, consistent with field effects, underlying carcinogenesis. This mechanism gives rise to extensive branching evolution and cancer clone mixing, as exemplified by the coexistence of multiple cancer lineages harboring distinct ERG fusions within a single cancer nodule. Subsets of mutations were shared either by morphologically normal and malignant tissues or between different ERG lineages, indicating earlier or separate clonal cell expansions.

Incidental prostate cancer in Asian men: high prevalence of incidental prostatic adenocarcinoma in Chinese patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy for treatment of bladder cancer and selection of candidates for prostate-sparing cystectomy.,"Yang, Xinyu; Monn, M Francesca; Liu, Libo; Liu, Yuli; Su, Jinwei; Lyu, Tianjing; Gong, Yanqing; Wang, Lisha; Davidson, Darrell D; Cheng, Liang","BACKGROUND: Previous studies report a low prevalence of incidental prostate cancer in Chinese patients (3-7%). We evaluated incidental prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) and urothelial carcinoma (UCa) involvement of the prostate in cystoprostatectomy specimens., METHODS: We analyzed 340 cystoprostatectomy specimens from patients who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy for the treatment of bladder cancer in China from 2004 to 2014. None of the patients had known prostate cancer prior to cystoprostatectomy., RESULTS: Overall, 180 (53%) patients had either PCa or UCa in the prostate. We found that 95 (28%) had PCa and 115 (34%) had UCa involvement of prostate. The rate of incidental prostate cancer was 21% and 31%, respectively, from two study periods (2004-2008 and 2009-2014). Among the 95 patients with PCa, 19 (20%) had Gleason score of >=7, nine (10%) had PCa tumor volume >0.5 cc, and eight (8.4%) had extracapsular extension. Of the 115 with prostatic UCa, 61 had prostatic urethra and/or periurethral prostatic duct involvement only, while 54 had prostatic stromal invasion. Age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.04, P = 0.001), increasing stage of bladder tumor (OR = 1.28, P = 0.005), multifocal tumors of bladder (OR = 3.22, P < 0.001), carcinoma in situ (CIS) in the bladder (OR = 5.52, P < 0.001), and bladder neck involvement (OR = 6.12, P < 0.001) were strongly associated with prostatic UCa., CONCLUSIONS: The rate of incidental PCa in cystoprostatectomy specimens in China has increased over the last decade. Patients with advanced age, elevated serum PSA level, advanced bladder tumor stage, multifocal bladder tumors, CIS in the bladder, and tumor location at the bladder neck should be excluded as candidates for prostate-sparing cystectomy.

Focal Ablation Targeted to the Index Lesion in Multifocal Localised Prostate Cancer: a Prospective Development Study.,"Ahmed, Hashim U; Dickinson, Louise; Charman, Susan; Weir, Shraddha; McCartan, Neil; Hindley, Richard G; Freeman, Alex; Kirkham, Alex P; Sahu, Mahua; Scott, Rebecca; Allen, Clare; Van der Meulen, Jan; Emberton, Mark","BACKGROUND: Although localised prostate cancer is multifocal in most instances, the index lesion might be responsible for disease progression., OBJECTIVE: To determine the early genitourinary functional and cancer control outcomes of index lesion ablation., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a single-centre prospective development study in which 56 men were treated (July 2009-January 2011). The mean age was 63.9 yr (standard deviation 5.8) and median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 7.4 ng/ml (interquartile range [IQR] 5.6-9.5). There were seven (12.5%) low-risk, 47 (83.9%) intermediate-risk, and two (3.6%) high-risk cancers., INTERVENTION: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and prostate biopsies to localise disease, followed by index lesion ablation using high-intensity focused ultrasound., OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Primary outcomes were genitourinary side effects measured using validated questionnaires. Secondary outcomes included absence of clinically significant disease at 12 mo., RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The composite of leak-free, pad-free continence, and erections sufficient for penetration decreased from a baseline frequency of 40/56 (71.4%) to 33/56 (58.9%) at 12 mo. Pad-free and leak-free, pad-free continence was preserved in 48/52 (92.3%) and 46/50 (92.0%) patients, respectively. Erections sufficient for intercourse were preserved in 30/39 (76.9%) patients. The median PSA nadir decreased to 2.4 ng/ml (IQR 1.6-4.1). At 12 mo, 42/52 (80.8%) patients had histological absence of clinically significant cancer and 85.7% (48/56) had no measurable prostate cancer (biopsy and/or mpMRI). Two (3.6%) patients had clinically significant disease in untreated areas not detected at baseline. The main study limitation is the short follow-up duration., CONCLUSIONS: Index lesion ablation had low rates of genitourinary side effects and acceptable short-term absence of clinically significant cancer. Comparative effectiveness trials are required to assess cancer control outcomes against radical therapy., PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study we looked at whether it is possible to treat the largest and highest-grade tumour in men who have more than one known prostate tumour. We show that the side effects of targeted ablation were low, with acceptable rates of early cancer control. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00988130.

[Cancer control in focus insights and future perspectives for the focal treatment of prostate cancer].,"Schostak, M; Kollermann, J; Hadaschik, B; Blana, A; Ganzer, R; Henkel, T; Kohrmann, K U; Liehr, U-B; Machtens, S; Roosen, A; Salomon, G; Sentker, L; Witzsch, U; Schlemmer, H-P; Baumunk, D","Faced with the dilemma of choosing between the extremes of standard whole gland therapy and active surveillance, those affected by prostate cancer have recently been on the lookout for less invasive alternatives. Particularly the question of whether it would be possible in low risk cancer to treat only the tumour itself while sparing the organ has long been considered. This article discusses the pros and cons of focal treatment and elucidates the latest innovative technologies. High overtreatment rates in low-risk patients submitted to standard therapy and considerable technological advances in diagnosis (particularly multiparametric MRI) and therapy are regarded by the authors as key arguments for abandoning complete tumour eradication with its side effects in favour of sufficient local cancer control by focal treatment with better preserved quality of life in suitable cases.

Risk of second cancers according to radiation therapy technique and modality in prostate cancer survivors.,"Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy; Wong, Jeannette; Kleinerman, Ruth; Kim, Clara; Morton, Lindsay; Bekelman, Justin E","PURPOSE: Radiation therapy (RT) techniques for prostate cancer are evolving rapidly, but the impact of these changes on risk of second cancers, which are an uncommon but serious consequence of RT, are uncertain. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of risks of second cancer according to RT technique (>10 MV vs <=10 MV and 3-dimensional [3D] vs 2D RT) and modality (external beam RT, brachytherapy, and combined modes) in a large cohort of prostate cancer patients., METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cohort was constructed using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database. We included cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in patients 66 to 84 years of age from 1992 to 2004 and followed through 2009. We used Poisson regression analysis to compare rates of second cancer across RT groups with adjustment for age, follow-up, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and comorbidities. Analyses of second solid cancers were based on the number of 5-year survivors (n=38,733), and analyses of leukemia were based on number of 2-year survivors (n=52,515) to account for the minimum latency period for radiation-related cancer., RESULTS: During an average of 4.4 years' follow-up among 5-year prostate cancer survivors (2DRT = 5.5 years; 3DRT = 3.9 years; and brachytherapy = 2.7 years), 2933 second solid cancers were diagnosed. There were no significant differences in second solid cancer rates overall between 3DRT and 2DRT patients (relative risk [RR] = 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91-1.09), but second rectal cancer rates were significantly lower after 3DRT (RR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.40-0.88). Rates of second solid cancers for higher- and lower-energy RT were similar overall (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.89-1.06), as were rates for site-specific cancers. There were significant reductions in colon cancer and leukemia rates in the first decade after brachytherapy compared to those after external beam RT., CONCLUSIONS: Advanced treatment planning may have reduced rectal cancer risks in prostate cancer survivors by approximately 3 cases per 1000 after 15 years. Despite concerns about the neutron doses, we did not find evidence that higher energy therapy was associated with increased second cancer risks.

Dosimetric comparison between jaw tracking and static jaw techniques in intensity-modulated radiotherapy.,"Feng, Zhongsu; Wu, Hao; Zhang, Yibao; Zhang, Yunjun; Cheng, Jinsheng; Su, Xu","PURPOSE: To compare the dosimetric differences between jaw tracking technique (JTT) and static jaw technique (SJT) in dynamic intensity-modulated radiotherapy (d-IMRT) and assess the potential advantages of jaw tracking technique., METHODS: Two techniques, jaw tracking and static jaw, were used respectively to develop the d-IMRT plans for 28 cancer patients with various lesion sites: head and neck, lungs, esophageal, abdominal, prostate, rectal and cervical. The dose volume histograms (DVH) and selected dosimetric indexes for the whole body and for organs at risk (OARs) were compared. A two dimensional ionization chamber Array Seven29 (PTW, Freiburg, Germany) and OCTAVIUS Octagonal phantom (PTW, Freiburg, Germany) were used to verify all the plans., RESULTS: For all patients, the treatment plans using both techniques met the clinical requirements. The V5, V10, V20, V30, V40 (volumes receiving 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 Gy at least, respectively), mean dose (Dmean) for the whole body and V5, V10, V20, Dmean for lungs in the JTT d-IMRT plans were significantly less than the corresponding values of the SJT d-IMRT plans (p < 0.001). The JTT d-IMRT plans deposited lower maximum dose (Dmax) to the lens, eyes, brainstem, spinal cord, and right optic nerve, the doses reductions for these OARs ranged from 2.2% to 28.6%. The JTT d-IMRT plans deposited significantly lower Dmean to various OARs (all p values < 0.05), the mean doses reductions for these OARs ranged from 1.1% to 31.0%, and the value reductions depend on the volume and the location of the OARs. The gamma evaluation method showed an excellent agreement between calculation and measurement for all techniques with criteria of 3%/3 mm., CONCLUSIONS: Both jaw tracking and static jaw d-IMRT plans can achieve comparable target dose coverage. JTT displays superior OARs sparing than SJT plans. These results are of clinical importance, especially for the patients with large and complex targets but close to some highly radio-sensitive organs to spare, and for patients with local recurrent or secondary primary malignant lesion within a previously irradiated area.",2015,/,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",10,101265111,28,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13014-015-0329-4,25623899,#2722,Feng 2015,,
CHEK2 mutations and the risk of papillary thyroid cancer.,"Siolek, Monika; Cybulski, Cezary; Gasior-Perczak, Danuta; Kowalik, Artur; Kozak-Klonowska, Beata; Kowalska, Aldona; Chlopek, Malgorzata; Kluzniak, Wojciech; Wokolorczyk, Dominika; Palyga, Iwona; Walczyk, Agnieszka; Lizis-Kolus, Katarzyna; Sun, Ping; Lubinski, Jan; Narod, Steven A; Gozdz, Stanislaw","Mutations in the cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) tumor suppressor gene are associated with multi-organ cancer susceptibility including cancers of the breast and prostate. A genetic association between thyroid and breast cancer has been suggested, however little is known about the determinants of this association. To characterize the association of CHEK2 mutations with thyroid cancer, we genotyped 468 unselected patients with papillary thyroid cancer and 468 (matched) cancer-free controls for four founder mutations of CHEK2 (1100delC, IVS2 + 1G>A, del5395 and I157T). We compared the family histories reported by patients with a CHEK2 mutation to those of non-carriers. A CHEK2 mutation was seen in 73 of 468 (15.6%) unselected patients with papillary thyroid cancer, compared to 28 of 460 (6.0%) age- and sex-matched controls (OR 3.3; p < 0.0001). A truncating mutation (IVS2 + 1G>A, 1100delC or del5395) was associated with a higher risk of thyroid cancer (OR = 5.7; p = 0.006), than was the missense mutation I157T (OR = 2.8; p = 0.0001). CHEK2 mutation carriers reported a family history of breast cancer 2.2 times more commonly than non-carriers (16.4% vs.8.1%; p = 0.05). A CHEK2 mutation was found in seven of 11 women (63%) with multiple primary cancers of the breast and thyroid (OR = 10; p = 0.0004). These results suggest that CHEK2 mutations predispose to thyroid cancer, familial aggregations of breast and thyroid cancer and to double primary cancers of the breast and thyroid.

Metastatic tumors of the penis: a report of 8 cases and review of the literature.,"Zhang, Ke; Da, Jun; Yao, Hai-Jun; Zheng, Da-Chao; Cai, Zhi-Kang; Jiang, Yue-Qing; Xu, Ming-Xi; Wang, Zhong","The purpose of this study was to report the clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of secondary penile cancers and review the literature of this rare condition. The records of 8 patients with metastatic penile cancer treated at our hospital from 2006 to 2013 were analyzed. A search of medical databases was conducted.Patient symptoms included penile mass (n = 7, 5 had concomitant pain) and acute urine retention (n = 1). The primary cancers included bladder, lung, gastric, liver, and prostate malignancies and 1 case of pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. The longest time from diagnosis of the primary cancer to metastatic penile cancer was 16 years and the shortest was 7 months. Six patients were treated with phallectomy, 1 with resection of the mass, and 1 with only a biopsy because of advanced metastatic disease. Five patients are deceased at the time of this report, and the longest and shortest survival times (from the diagnosis of primary cancer to the death) were 16 years and 9 months, respectively. The literature review identified 17 cases reported since 2011, bringing the total number of reported cases to 480. Genitourinary cancer, primarily bladder and prostate, account for approximately 70 of the primary cancer sites and gastrointestinal cancers account for approximately 21%. Approximately half of the patients had died of their disease within 1 year of the diagnosis of penile metastasis. The prognosis of metastatic penile cancer is poor. Most primary cancers are in the urologic or gastrointestinal systems.

Additional Primary Malignancies in Patients with Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST): A Clinicopathologic Study of 260 Patients with Molecular Analysis and Review of the Literature.,"Hechtman, Jaclyn Frances; DeMatteo, Ronald; Nafa, Khedoudja; Chi, Ping; Arcila, Maria E; Dogan, Snjezana; Oultache, Alifya; Chen, Wen; Hameed, Meera","BACKGROUND: The incidence of other primary neoplasms in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients is relatively high. Our aim was to better characterize the clinicopathologic and molecular relationships in a cohort of GIST patients., METHODS: All GIST patients with tumor samples sent for molecular testing were identified via electronic medical records. Clinicopathologic characteristics of GIST and additional primary malignancies were analyzed., RESULTS: Of 260 patients, 50 (19 %) had at least one additional primary malignancy. In 33 patients, separate primary neoplasms predated their GIST diagnosis and most commonly included: prostate (n = 9), breast (n = 8), and hematologic (n = 5). Renal (n = 4) and hematologic (n = 3) malignancies were the most frequent cancers identified after GIST diagnosis. The majority (8 of 12, 66 %) of malignancies diagnosed after GIST were found incidentally. Patients who developed other malignancies after GIST more often had KIT exon 11 mutations (100 vs. 66 %, P = 0.01). In comparison to patients with only GIST, patients with a second primary neoplasm of any chronology had GISTs with increased mitotic rate (>=5 per 50 high-power fields) (P = 0.0006). Literature review revealed colorectal cancer, gastric, prostate, renal, leukemia, and desmoid-type fibromatosis as the most common secondary neoplasms., CONCLUSIONS: Nineteen percent of GIST patients develop other malignancies. This is the first report to describe a relationship between additional primary malignancy and both mutation and mitotic rate of GIST. Although the basis of these relationships remains to be investigated, caution in the clinical management of GIST patients with additional lesions is warranted.",2015,/,Annals of surgical oncology,22,8,Sep-33,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1245/s10434-014-4332-z,25564173,#2725,Hechtman 2015,,
Prognostic impact of synchronous second primary malignancies on the overall survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.,"Koo, Kyo Chul; Yoo, Hanna; Kim, Ki Hong; Park, Sang Un; Han, Kyung Seok; Rha, Koon Ho; Hong, Sung Joon; Yang, Seung Choul; Chung, Byung Ha","PURPOSE: We determined the prognostic impact of a synchronous second primary malignancy on overall survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Identifying features that stratify the risk of overall survival is critical for judiciously applying definitive therapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 582 consecutive patients with prostate cancer diagnosed with metastasis between May 7, 1998 and August 27, 2011. Patient age, body mass index, ECOG performance status, Charlson comorbidity index, prostate specific antigen, T and N stages, Gleason and ASA R scores, progression to castration resistant prostate cancer, prior local treatments and synchronous second primary malignancies at metastasis were assessed. A synchronous second primary malignancy was defined as a cytologically or histologically proven solid malignancy. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was done to estimate overall survival by second primary type and evaluate predictive variables., RESULTS: A total of 164 patients (28.1%) had a synchronous second primary malignancy, of which colorectal (9.1%), stomach (7.3%) and lung (7.1%) cancers were the most prevalent types. During a median followup of 34.1 months patients without a synchronous second primary malignancy had a significantly higher overall survival rate than those with lung or stomach cancer. However, men without a second malignancy had outcomes comparable to those in men with colorectal cancer. Clinical stage T4 or greater, ASA score 1 or greater and lung or stomach cancer were independent predictors of overall mortality., CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of patients with metastatic prostate cancer present with a synchronous second primary malignancy. Definitive therapy targeting prostate cancer may confer a limited survival benefit in patients with synchronous lung or stomach cancer.

The identification of incident cancers in UK primary care databases: a systematic review.,"Ranopa, Michael; Douglas, Ian; van Staa, Tjeerd; Smeeth, Liam; Klungel, Olaf; Reynolds, Robert; Bhaskaran, Krishnan","PURPOSE: UK primary care databases are frequently used in observational studies with cancer outcomes. We aimed to systematically review methods used by such studies to identify and validate incident cancers of the breast, colorectum, and prostate., METHODS: Medline and Embase (1980-2013) were searched for UK primary care database studies with incident breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer outcomes. Data on the methods used for case ascertainment were extracted and summarised. Questionnaires were sent to corresponding authors to obtain details about case ascertainment., RESULTS: Eighty-four studies of breast (n = 51), colorectal (n = 54), and prostate cancer (n = 31) were identified; 30 examined >1 cancer type. Among the 84 studies, 57 defined cancers using only diagnosis codes, while 27 required further evidence such as chemotherapy. Few studies described methods used to create cancer code lists (n = 5); or made lists available directly (n = 5). Twenty-eight code lists were received on request from study authors. All included malignant neoplasm diagnosis codes, but there was considerable variation in the specific codes included which was not explained by coding dictionary changes. Code lists also varied in terms of other types of codes included, such as in-situ, cancer morphology, history of cancer, and secondary/suspected/borderline cancer codes., CONCLUSIONS: In UK primary care database studies, methods for identifying breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers were often unclear. Code lists were often unavailable, and where provided, we observed variation in the individual codes and types of codes included. Clearer reporting of methods and publication of code lists would improve transparency and reproducibility of studies.

Second primary cancers in the Vaud and Neuchatel Cancer Registries.,"Levi, Fabio; Randimbison, Lalao; Rafael, Blanc-Moya; Manuela, Maspoli-Conconi; La Vecchia, Carlo","An increasing proportion of new cancers is registered in patients who have received a previous cancer diagnosis. As data are inconsistent across studies, we provided information for populations long covered by valid cancer registration. Data were derived from the Swiss cancer Registries of Vaud and Neuchatel (885,000 inhabitants). Patients diagnosed with a new malignancy (except skin basal and squamous cell carcinomas) during the period 2005-2010 were included. Over the period 2005-2010, 24,859 patients were registered with incident cancer. Of these, 3127 (13%) had multiple primary cancers and 578 (2.3%) were synchronous. Breast, prostate, colorectum, skin, melanomas, and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SHN) and bladder/ureter were the most common sites of first neoplasms, whereas breast, lung, colorectum, prostate, melanoma, and SHN were the most common sites of second neoplasms. The most common pairing was breast with breast (31% synchronous), followed by the bladder/ureter with the prostate (72% synchronous), prostate with the colorectum, SHN with SHN, and SHN with lung. Five-year crude survival of patients with synchronous cancers (34%) was not significantly lower than that of patients with single neoplasms (39%). This population-based study indicates that about one in eight incident neoplasms in these mature registries are second neoplasms and almost 1/40 patients are diagnosed with synchronous primary cancers. These are related to shared genetic and environmental factors as well as diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

Is there any prognostic impact of intraductal carcinoma of prostate in initial diagnosed aggressively metastatic prostate cancer?.,"Zhao, Tao; Liao, Banghua; Yao, Jin; Liu, Jiyan; Huang, Rui; Shen, Pengfei; Peng, Zhufeng; Gui, Haojun; Chen, Xueqin; Zhang, Peng; Zhu, Yuchun; Li, Xiang; Wei, Qiang; Zhou, Qiao; Zeng, Hao; Chen, Ni","BACKGROUND: Intraductal carcinoma of prostate (IDC-P) was usually found to be co-exist with conventional aggressive prostate adenocarcinoma. The presence of IDC-P was considered as an adverse pathological factor, which was associated with high Gleason score, large prostate volume and accelerated disease progression. However, no any information is available on the presence of IDC-P diagnosed by needle biopsy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. We investigated the incidence and prognostic value of intraductal carcinoma of prostate (IDC-P) in initial diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer., METHODS: We included 278 patients with initial diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer treated between 2008 and 2011, all the pathological diagnosis were from ultrasonic-guided transperineal needle biopsy. IDC-P was strictly defined according to Epstein's criteria. Analyzed factors included age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, clinical T staging, Gleason scores, baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), hemoglobin (HGB), PSA normalization, and the presence of IDC-P., RESULTS: Totally, IDC-P was found in 57/278 (20.5%) cases. Univariate analysis showed that, compared with cases without IDC-P, cases with IDC-P was definitely associated with much shorter CRPC-free survival (CFS) time (46.05 +/- 1.39 vs. 22.98 +/- 1.80 months, P = 0.000) and OS time (50.38 +/- 1.18 vs. 36.43 +/- 2.10 months, P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of IDC-P was the only independent prognostic factor associated with poor CFS (HR = 4.886, P = 0.011) and OS (HR = 1.945, P = 0.020). Further sub-analysis showed, even among patients with higher Gleason score (>=8) (n = 158), IDC-P was still significantly and inversely associated with CFS and OS (the median CFS time: 40 versus 22 months; P = 0.000; the median OS time: 54 vs. 36 months, P = 0.000). Again, Cox's regression model confirmed that only the presence of IDC-P was still not only an independent prognostic factor predicting shorter time of CRPC (HR = 4.031, P = 0.035), but also for poorer OS (HR = 2.499, P = 0.006)., CONCLUSIONS: The presence of IDC-P in initial diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, even among patients with more aggressive pattern, was firstly found to be significantly and independently associated with earlier occurrence of CRPC and poorer OS. We recommended the presence of IDC-P should be a routine record in pathological report of clinical diagnosis and other potential therapeutic regimen might be added to intervene in the integrated therapy as early as possible.

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging predicts the presence of prostate cancer in patients with negative prostate biopsy.,"Lista, F; Castillo, E; Gimbernat, H; Rodriguez-Barbero, J M; Panizo, J; Angulo, J C","OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to detect prostate cancer in patients with prior negative transrectal prostate biopsy (TPB)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: mpMRI (TSE-T2-w, DWI and DCE sequences) was performed on 1.5T (Magnetom Avanto; Siemens Healthcare Solutions) in 150 patients suspicious of prostate cancer and with negative TPB. European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) criteria were used (score 1: clinically significant disease is highly unlikely to be present; score 2: clinically significant cancer is unlikely to be present; score 3: clinically significant cancer is equivocal; score 4: clinically significant cancer is likely to be present; score 5: clinically significant cancer is highly likely to be present). PSA measurement (total and free), digital rectal examination (DRE), transrectal ultrasound (TRU) and a second TPB (at least 14 cylinders) were performed in all patients. Variables were submitted for independent blind analysis. The accuracy of each test was measured. Stepwise selection model for prediction of prostate cancer in second TPB was developed., RESULTS: Mean age was 66.2+/- 5 years (51-77), mean PSA 11.3+/- 9.6ng/mL (0.9-75) and mean prostatic volume 82.2+/-42 (20-250) cc. DRE was suspicious in 11 (7.3%) patients. The mean number of cylinders per patient sampled in second TRB was 17.6+/-2.7(14-22). Second TRB was positive in 28 patients (18.7%). mpMRI was positive (score 3-5) in 102 (68%), test sensibility was 92.9% and the NPV was 95.8%. The risk of prostate cancer diagnosis in second TPB is modified by: PSA velocity > 0.75 (OR 1.04 [0.99-1.08]; P=0.06), free/total ratio PSA <15% (OR 0.37 [0.13-1.05]; P=0.06), each cc. of prostate volume (OR 0.98 [0.97-1]; P=0.017) and mpMRI 3-5 (OR 7.87 [1.78-34.7]; P=0.006). Multivariate analysis reveals that mpMRI (OR 7.41 [1.65-33.28]; P=0.009) and prostatic volume (OR 0.31 [0.12-0.78]; P=0.01) are independent risk predictors of prostate cancer., CONCLUSIONS: According to ESUR guidelines and in patients with prior negative prostate biopsy, mpMRI is a valuable tool for the prediction of prostate cancer in second TPB.

Multifocality and prostate cancer detection by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging: correlation with whole-mount histopathology.,"Le, Jesse D; Tan, Nelly; Shkolyar, Eugene; Lu, David Y; Kwan, Lorna; Marks, Leonard S; Huang, Jiaoti; Margolis, Daniel J A; Raman, Steven S; Reiter, Robert E","BACKGROUND: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) is increasingly used in prostate cancer (CaP). Understanding the limitations of tumor detection, particularly in multifocal disease, is important in its clinical application., OBJECTIVE: To determine predictors of CaP detection by mp-MRI as confirmed by whole-mount histopathology., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective study was performed of 122 consecutive men who underwent mp-MRI before radical prostatectomy at a single referral academic center. A genitourinary radiologist and pathologist collectively determined concordance., OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The odds of tumor detection were calculated for clinical, MRI, and histopathologic variables using a multivariate logistic regression model., RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The 122 patients had 283 unique histologically confirmed CaP tumor foci. Gleason score was 6 in 21 (17%), 7 in 88 (72%), and >=8 in 13 (11%) patients. Of the 122 cases, 44 (36%) had solitary and 78 (64%) had multifocal tumors. Overall mp-MRI sensitivity for tumor detection was 47% (132/283), with increased sensitivity for larger (102/141 [72%] >1.0 cm), higher-grade (96/134 [72%] Gleason >=7) tumors, and index tumors (98/122 [80%]). Index tumor status, size, and prostate weight were significant predictors of detection in a multivariate analysis, and multifocality did not adversely impact detection of index tumors. A prostatectomy population was necessary by design, which may limit the ability to generalize these results., CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity for tumor detection increased with tumor size and grade. Index tumor status and tumor size were the strongest predictors of tumor detection, regardless of tumor focality. Some 80% of index tumors were detected, but nonindex tumor detection, even of high-grade lesions, was poor. These findings have important implications for focal therapy., PATIENT SUMMARY: We evaluated the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect cancer in patients undergoing prostatectomy. We found that tumor size and grade were important predictors of tumor detection, and although cancer is often multifocal, MRI is often able to detect the worst focus of cancer. Copyright © 2014.

"Trends in cancer incidence in rural Eastern Cape Province; South Africa, 1998-2012.","Somdyala, Ntuthu I M; Parkin, D Maxwell; Sithole, Nomfuneko; Bradshaw, Debbie","There are few cancer trend data reported in sub-Saharan Africa notably due to the scarcity of population-based cancer registries (PBCRs). The Eastern Cape Province PBCR is amongst the few registries in sub-Saharan Africa that reports data for a rural population. Trends in cancer incidence are reported for the period 1998-2012. Registered cases, age-standardized rates (ASRs) and standardized rate ratios are presented for the most common cancers in both males and females in three periods (1998-2002, 2003-2007 and 2008-2012). In males, the most commonly diagnosed cancer during the 15 year period was cancer of the oesophagus; incidence rates showed a significant decline over the 15 year period, entirely due to a 30% decrease between 2003-2007 and 2008-2012, to an ASR of 23.2 per 100,000 population. This was followed by prostate cancer, the incidence of which was more than doubled to a level of 9.9/100,000. In women, cancer of the cervix uteri has become the most common malignancy, with a significant increase in incidence during the period to 29.0/100,000. Oesophageal cancer is second in frequency, with (as in males) a significant decline in the final 10 years to an incidence of 14.5/100,000 in 2008-2012. The incidence of breast cancer increased by 61%, although the absolute rate remains low (12.2/100,000). The incidence rates of colorectal cancer are low, and the increases in incidence, although relatively large (35% in men, 63% in women) were not statistically significant. Kaposi sarcoma showed a dramatic increase in incidence in both sexes (3.5-fold in men, 11-fold in women) although the incidence remains relatively low by southern African standards. Cancer prevention and control activities in the area need to be informed by these data and strengthened.

The overall risks of a second primary cancer were elevated by 6% in patients who had thyroid cancer compared with the general population during the same period. The elevated risks for developing second cancers were observed in all sites except the stomach and cervix. The elevated risk of second primary cancers was observed within the first 10 years of follow-up. Leukemia and cancers of the salivary gland, kidney, prostate, lung, and breast had the most significantly elevated risks as secondary cancers and presented as early as during the first 5 years after the initial diagnosis of thyroid cancer., CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest, standardized, population-based study to date using nationwide data from the entire Korean population. The risks of several cancers were elevated significantly during follow-up, thus alerting physicians to pay special attention in their care of patients with thyroid cancer and long-term survivors.

Coupling of prostate and thyroid cancer diagnoses in the United States.,"Tomaszewski, Jeffrey J; Uzzo, Robert G; Egleston, Brian; Corcoran, Anthony T; Mehrazin, Reza; Geynisman, Daniel M; Ridge, John A; Veloski, Colleen; Kocher, Neil; Smaldone, Marc C; Kutikov, Alexander","BACKGROUND: Prostate and thyroid cancers represent two of the most overdiagnosed tumors in the US. Hypothesizing that patients diagnosed with one of these malignancies were more likely to be diagnosed with the other, we examined the coupling of diagnoses of prostate and thyroid cancer in a large US administrative dataset., METHODS: The surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database was used to identify men diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer (CaP) or thyroid cancer between 1995 and 2010. SEER*stat software was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and investigate the rates of subsequent malignancy diagnosis. Additional non-urologic cancer sites were added as control groups., RESULTS: Patients with thyroid cancer were much more likely to be diagnosed with CaP than patients in the SEER control group (SIR 1.28 [95% CI 1.1-1.5]; p < 0.05). Similarly, the observed incidence of thyroid cancer was significantly higher in patients with CaP when compared with SEER controls (SIR 1.30 [95% CI 1.2-1.4]; p < 0.05). When stratified by follow-up interval, the observed thyroid cancer diagnosis rate among men with CaP was significantly higher than expected at 2-11 (SIR 1.83 [95% CI 1.4-2.4]), 12-59 (SIR 1.24 [95% CI 1.0-1.5]), and 60-119 (SIR 1.25 [95% CI 1.0-1.5]) months of follow-up. There was no increased risk of CaP or thyroid cancer diagnosis among patients with non-urologic malignancies., CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant association of diagnoses with prostate and thyroid cancer in the US.

Median follow-up times for the two cohorts were 136 and 29 months, respectively. Nine patients developed secondary cancers in the chemotherapy group. These included two breast cancers, three myelodysplastic syndromes/acute myeloid leukemia, one vulvar cancer, one prostate cancer, one colon cancer and one soft tissue sarcoma.

Receipt of best care according to current quality of care measures and outcomes in men with prostate cancer.,"Schroeck, Florian R; Kaufman, Samuel R; Jacobs, Bruce L; Hollenbeck, Brent K","PURPOSE: We evaluated whether patients with prostate cancer who received best care according to a set of 5 nationally endorsed quality measures had decreased treatment related morbidity and improved cancer control., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study we included 38,055 men from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare database treated for localized prostate cancer between 2004 and 2010. We determined whether each patient received best care, defined as care adherent to all applicable measures. We measured associations of best care with the need for interventions, addressing treatment related morbidity, and with the need for secondary cancer therapy using Cox proportional hazards models., RESULTS: Only 3,412 men (9.0%) received best care. Five years after treatment these men and men who did not receive best care had a similar likelihood of undergoing procedures for urinary morbidity (prostatectomy subset 10.7% vs 12.9%, p = 0.338) and secondary cancer therapy (prostatectomy for high risk prostate cancer subset 40.9% vs 37.3%, p = 0.522). However, they were more likely to be treated with a procedure for sexual morbidity (prostatectomy 17.3% vs 10.8%, p <0.001). Similar trends were observed in men treated with radiotherapy., CONCLUSIONS: Overall men who received best care did not fare better in regard to treatment related morbidity or cancer control. Collectively our findings suggest that the current process of care measures are not tightly linked to outcomes and further research is needed to identify better measures that are meaningful and important to patients.

The purpose of this study is to summarize longterm trends in the cancer burden and to provide up-to-date estimates of incidence and mortality rates after 2011., DATA AND METHODS: The Czech National Cancer Registry (CNCR) was instituted in 1977 and contains information collected over a 34-year period of standardized registration covering 100% of cancer diagnoses within the entire Czech population. The CNCR analysis is supported by demographic data and by the Death Records Database. An overview of the epidemiology of malignant tumors in the Czech population is available online at www.svod.cz., RESULTS: All neoplasms, including nonmelanoma skin cancer, reached a crude incidence rate of almost 802 cases per 100,000 men and 681 cases per 100,000 women in 2011. The annual mortality rate exceeded 258 deaths per 100,000 individuals; in other words, more than 27,000 individuals die of cancer each year. The overall incidence of malignancies has increased with a growth index of +27.6% during the last decade (2001- 2011), while the mortality rate has been stabilized over the time span (growth index in 2001- 2011: - 5.0%). Consequently, the prevalence has significantly increased in the observed period and exceeded 475,000 cases in 2011. In addition to demographic aging of the Czech population, the cancer burden has also increased due to the growing incidence of multiple primary tumors (recently more than 15% of the total incidence). The most frequent diagnoses include colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Although some neoplasms are increasingly diagnosed at an early stage (e. g. the proportion of stage I or II was 75.3% for female breast cancer and 84.2% for skin melanoma), the numbers of early diagnosed cases are generally insufficient, even in the case of highly prevalent cancers such as colorectal carcinoma (only 46.1% of incident cases are diagnosed at stage I or II, according to recent data)., CONCLUSION: Population-based data on malignant tumors are available in the Czech Republic. The data survey can help us define national cancer management priorities. The current priority is to achieve a sustained reduction of cases diagnosed at an advanced stage and reduction of the significant regional differences in diagnostic efficiency.",2014,/,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,27,6,406-23,,,25493580,#2740,Dusek 2014,,
Breast and prostate cancer: an analysis of common epidemiological features in mortality trends in Spain.,"Lopez-Abente, Gonzalo; Mispireta, Sergio; Pollan, Marina","BACKGROUND: Breast cancer in women and prostate cancer are the first and second leading tumour respectively in terms of incidence world-wide. Our objective is to ascertain the similarities and differences between mortality trends in breast cancer among women and prostate cancer in Spain using age-period-cohort models, and analyse the correlation between incidence of breast and prostate cancer at cancer registries locally and world-wide., METHODS: We analysed the independent effects of age, period of death and birth cohort on mortality rates for breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in Spain across the period 1952-2011. Segmented regression analyses were performed to detect and estimate changes in period and cohort curvatures. Correlation among age-adjusted incidence rates at 246 population cancer registries world-wide was analysed for the period 2003-2007., RESULTS: The mortality trend displayed common characteristics in terms of the annual number of deaths due to these tumours, their adjusted mortality rates and the change points detected in the cohort and period effects. The trend in incidence was very different to that in mortality, due to early detection and progressive improvement in survival. Correlation between the incidence rates of both tumours recorded by registries around the world proved to be a generalised phenomenon., CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that breast cancer mortality in women and prostate cancer mortality and their trends in Spain display visible similarities in terms of the number of deaths due to these tumours, their adjusted mortality rates and the changes experienced by mortality over time. The effects of advances in the diagnosis of both tumours correspond to a decline in mortality which becomes evident after a lag of approximately eight years.

The use of dietary supplements to alleviate androgen deprivation therapy side effects during prostate cancer treatment.,"Dueregger, Andrea; Heidegger, Isabel; Ofer, Philipp; Perktold, Bernhard; Ramoner, Reinhold; Klocker, Helmut; Eder, Iris E","Prostate cancer (PCa), the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of male cancer death in Western societies, is typically androgen-dependent, a characteristic that underlies the rationale of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Approximately 90% of patients initially respond to ADT strategies, however many experience side effects including hot flashes, cardiotoxicity, metabolic and musculoskeletal alterations. This review summarizes pre-clinical and clinical studies investigating the ability of dietary supplements to alleviate adverse effects arising from ADT. In particular, we focus on herbal compounds, phytoestrogens, selenium (Se), fatty acids (FA), calcium, and Vitamins D and E. Indeed, there is some evidence that calcium and Vitamin D can prevent the development of osteoporosis during ADT. On the other hand, caution should be taken with the antioxidants Se and Vitamin E until the basis underlying their respective association with type 2 diabetes mellitus and PCa tumor development has been clarified. However, many other promising supplements have not yet been subjected large-scale clinical trials making it difficult to assess their efficacy. Given the demographic trend of increased PCa diagnoses and dependence on ADT as a major therapeutic strategy, further studies are required to objectively evaluate these supplements as adjuvant for PCa patients receiving ADT.",2014,/,Nutrients,6,10,4491-519,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu6104491,25338271,#2742,Dueregger 2014,,

Operator dependent choice of prostate cancer biopsy has limited impact on a gene signature analysis for the highly expressed genes IGFBP3 and F3 in prostate cancer epithelial cells.,"Peng, Zhuochun; Andersson, Karl; Lindholm, Johan; Bodin, Inger; Pramana, Setia; Pawitan, Yudi; Nister, Monica; Nilsson, Sten; Li, Chunde","BACKGROUND: Predicting the prognosis of prostate cancer disease through gene expression analysis is receiving increasing interest. In many cases, such analyses are based on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) core needle biopsy material on which Gleason grading for diagnosis has been conducted. Since each patient typically has multiple biopsy samples, and since Gleason grading is an operator dependent procedure known to be difficult, the impact of the operator's choice of biopsy was evaluated., METHODS: Multiple biopsy samples from 43 patients were evaluated using a previously reported gene signature of IGFBP3, F3 and VGLL3 with potential prognostic value in estimating overall survival at diagnosis of prostate cancer. A four multiplex one-step qRT-PCR test kit, designed and optimized for measuring the signature in FFPE core needle biopsy samples was used. Concordance of gene expression levels between primary and secondary Gleason tumor patterns, as well as benign tissue specimens, was analyzed., RESULTS: The gene expression levels of IGFBP3 and F3 in prostate cancer epithelial cell-containing tissue representing the primary and secondary Gleason patterns were high and consistent, while the low expressed VGLL3 showed more variation in its expression levels., CONCLUSION: The assessment of IGFBP3 and F3 gene expression levels in prostate cancer tissue is independent of Gleason patterns, meaning that the impact of operator's choice of biopsy is low.",2014,/,PloS one,9,10,e109610,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0109610,25296164,#2744,Peng 2014,,
Incidental prostate cancer prevalence at radical cystoprostatectomy--importance of the histopathological work-up.,"Wetterauer, C; Weibel, M; Gsponer, J R; Vlajnic, T; Zellweger, T; Butikofer, S; Muller, G; Puschel, H; Bachmann, A; Gasser, T C; Bubendorf, L; Rentsch, C A","The reported incidental prostate cancer prevalence rates at radical cystoprostatectomy cover a range from 4 to 60 %. We investigated the influence of the histopathological work-up on prostate cancer prevalence rates. We identified 114 patients who had undergone cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer between 2000 and 2012. Complete histopathological assessment was defined as follows: (i) complete embedding of the prostate gland, (ii) sectioning of 15 or more prostate sections, and (iii) processing as whole mount slides. Prostate cancer prevalence rates derived from complete and incomplete histopathological assessments were compared. The overall prostate cancer prevalence rate was 59.6 %. A mean of 14.4 macroscopic tissue sections (thickness 3-5 mm) were sectioned. Sectioning >=15 sections resulted in a prostate cancer detection rate of 75 %, compared to 42.6 % when sectioning <15 sections (p < 0.001). Complete embedding yielded a prostate cancer detection rate of 72.3 and of 23.1 % for partly embedded prostates (p < 0.0001). Prostate cancer was detected in 68.8 % of the whole mounted samples and in 38.2 % of the samples sectioned as standard slides (p < 0.01); according to the criteria described by Epstein and Ohori, 44.1 % of the detected prostate cancers were clinically significant.

Co-prevalence of other tumors in patients harboring pituitary tumors.,"Couldwell, William T; Cannon-Albright, Lisa A","OBJECT: The cause of most pituitary tumors remains unknown, although a genetic contribution is recognized for some. The prevalence of pituitary tumors in the general population is high. Analyzing the Utah Population Database (UPDB), the authors investigated the co-prevalence of other independent primary tumors in patients with known pituitary tumors, both benign and malignant, and in the relatives of these patients., METHODS: The authors identified individuals in the Utah Cancer Registry diagnosed with pituitary tumors who also had genealogy data in the UPDB and then calculated relative risks (RRs) of other tumors in these patients and their relatives., RESULTS: Among the 591 individuals with pituitary tumors, 16 (2.7%) had a malignant pituitary tumor and 77 (13%) had independent primary tumors of other origin. Overall, this is significantly higher than expected (70.6 expected, p = 0.009) within the general population (RR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.06-1.61). A significant excess for several different cancer sites was observed among the first-, second-, and third-degree relatives of the cases, including prostate and other cancers.

Prostate cancer detection rate at second and third biopsy. Predictive factors and risk groups for cancer diagnosis.,"Castello-Porcar, Ana; Garcia-Morata, Francisco; Martinez-Jabaloyas, Jose Maria","OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of prostate cancer is obtained with the performance of a prostate biopsy. Repetition of biopsies is required in patients with negative biopsies when there is high suspicion for cancer. The objective of this study is to know the prostate cancer detection rate in second and third prostatic biopsies and to identify the clinical factors with predictive value for positivity. We also want to establish risk groups for cancer diagnosis after one or two previous negative biopsies., METHODS: Retrospective study of patients undergoing a second or third prostatic biopsy. We determined the rate of cancer diagnosis for both. We performed univariate and multivariate analysis (multiple logistic regression) to analyse any relationship between clinical variables (PSA, PSA density, PSA F/T ratio, PSA velocity, digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasonography, prostate volume, time between biopsies, pathological result and number of cores obtained in the first biopsy) and positivity in the second and third biopsies. Logistic regression analysis was performed to know which factors are predictors for positivity in 2nd and 3 th biopsies. According to the probabilities obtained, different risk groups were established., RESULTS: 4.532 patients underwent prostate biopsy between 1999 and 2010. 663 patients were included for second biopsy and 191 for third biopsy. Detection rates for prostate cancer were 24,3% and 17.8% respectively. According to the multivariate analysis, the probability for positivity on second biopsy increases when first biopsy was sextant (p=0,049), patients were >65 years old (p=0,005) and PSA density was >0,15 (p=0,000). Four risk groups were established with a range of probability for prostate cancer between 7 and 37%.

Cancer incidence was compared with the age-matched general population using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Pelvic malignancies included invasive and noninvasive bladder cancer and rectal cancer. Cox multivariable analysis was performed with adjustment for covariates to determine whether treatment (RP vs BT) was associated with second malignancy risk., RESULTS: The median age at BT was 66 years and at RP 62 years. The SIR comparing BT patients with the general population was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-1.22) for second malignancy and was 1.53 (95% CI 1.12-2.04) for pelvic malignancy. The SIR comparing RP patients with the general population was 1.11 (95% CI 0.98-1.25) for second malignancy and was 1.11 (95% CI 0.82-1.48) for pelvic malignancy. On multivariable analysis, older age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05) and smoking (HR 1.65) were associated with increased second malignancy risk (P<.0001). Radical prostatectomy was not associated with a decreased second malignancy risk relative to BT (HR 0.90, P=.43), even when excluding patients who received postprostatectomy external beam radiation therapy (HR 1.13, P=.25). Older age (HR 1.09, P<.0001) and smoking (HR 2.17, P=.0009) were associated with increased pelvic malignancy risk. Radical prostatectomy was not associated with a decreased pelvic malignancy risk compared with BT (HR 0.57, P=.082), even when excluding postprostatectomy external beam radiation therapy patients (HR 0.87, P=.56)., CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for covariates, BT patients did not have an increased second malignancy risk compared with RP patients.

Internationally a major focus on understanding variations in cancer outcomes has been later presentation to healthcare and later diagnosis. Approaches to reducing time to diagnosis of symptomatic cancer include public symptom awareness campaigns and interventions in primary care to improve early cancer detection. This paper reports the protocol of a factorial cluster-randomised trial of community and general practice (GP) level interventions to reduce the time to diagnosis of cancer in rural Western Australia (WA)., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The community intervention is a symptom awareness campaign tailored for rural Australians delivered through a community engagement model. The GP intervention includes a resource card with symptom risk assessment charts and local referral pathways implemented through multiple academic detailing visits and case studies. Participants are eligible if recently diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung or prostate cancer who reside in specific regions of rural WA with a planned sample size of 1350. The primary outcome is the Total Diagnostic Interval, defined as the duration from first symptom (or date of cancer screening test) to cancer diagnosis.

The length of a positive surgical margin is of prognostic significance in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.,"Servoll, Einar; Vlatkovic, Ljiljana; Saeter, Thorstein; Nesland, Jahn M; Axcrona, Ulrika; Waaler, Gudmund; Axcrona, Karol","OBJECTIVE: To establish predictors of clinical failure in patients operated with radical prostatectomy (RP) for clinically localized prostate cancer (PC) by analyzing the pathological characteristics of positive surgical margins (PSM)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The RP specimens of 303 consecutive patients operated with RP between 1985 and 2009 were reviewed. PSM were analyzed with regard to the PSM length, location and multifocality and the Gleason score (GS) at the PSM., RESULTS: Of the 163 patients with PSM, 79 (48%) progressed to clinical failure compared to 30 (22%) in the negative-margin-status group. In univariate analysis, a GS at the PSM >=4 + 3 = 7 (p = 0. 013) and a PSM length >3.0 mm (p < 0.005) were significantly associated with higher clinical failure rates compared to a GS at the PSM <=3 + 4 = 7 and <=3.0 mm in extent, respectively. A linear extent of the PSM <=3.0 mm appeared to have the same clinical outcome as in the group with a negative margin status. In multivariate analysis, a PSM length >3.0 mm remained an independent predictor of clinical failure., CONCLUSIONS: PSM length is an independent predictor of clinical failure following RP.

Radiation-induced secondary malignancy in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Jin, Tao; Song, Turun; Deng, Shi; Wang, Kunjie","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of radiation-induced secondary malignancy in patients with prostate cancer., METHODS: We identified 690 references from PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library before August 1, 2012, that reported secondary malignancy in patients with prostate cancer after receiving radiation therapy (RT), and finally four studies were included. We calculated summary estimates using random-effects meta-analysis., RESULTS: The overall standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of secondary malignancy in patients with prostate cancer receiving RT to the general population was 1.14 (95% CI 1.04-1.32). In the subgroup analysis, no increment in radiation-induced secondary malignancy risk was detected. In terms of SIR with different follow-up intervals, there was no difference in SIR (>6 months; <5 years) (SIR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.75-1.89) and SIR (>5 years; <10 years) (SIR = 1.39, 95% CI 0.87-2.23). When the follow-up extended to >10 years, a significantly increased secondary malignancy risk was observed (SIR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.23-1.72). There is no significantly increased secondary malignancy risk in patients receiving no RT., CONCLUSION: RT is associated with increased secondary malignancy in patients with prostate cancer; this effect only become conspicuous more than 10 years after treatment.

Incidence of additional primary malignancies in patients with pancreatic and gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors.,"Kauffmann, Rondi M; Wang, Li; Phillips, Sharon; Idrees, Kamran; Merchant, Nipun B; Parikh, Alexander A","BACKGROUND: The incidence of secondary malignancies is increased in patients with malignant and premalignant conditions. Although neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are uncommon, their incidence is increasing. We evaluated the rate of additional malignancies in patients with NET., METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we identified a cohort of patients with pancreatic NET (PNET) or gastrointestinal NET (GINET). We determined the incidence of additional cancers diagnosed either before or after the diagnosis of PNET or GINET, by comparing these rates with the general population. Using multivariable regression, we evaluated factors that increased the risk of an additional malignancy., RESULTS: A cohort of 9,727 NET patients was identified. A total of 3,086 additional cancers occurred in 2,508 patients (25.8 %). The most common sites of additional malignancies included colorectal (21.1 %), prostate (14.5 %), breast (13.3 %), and lung (11.6 %). Among patients with PNET, the incidence of breast, lung, uterine, lymph, and pancreatic cancers was less than expected in the general population, whereas in patients with GINET, the observed incidence of nearly all malignancies exceeded that expected. Increasing age, marital status, and localized NET were associated with increased risk., CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the incidence of additional malignancies in patients with PNET and GINET is 25.8 %. Patients with GINET are at increased risk of additional malignancies, whereas patients with PNET have a decreased risk compared with the general population. More vigilant surveillance for secondary malignancies should be performed in patients with GINET.

Incidence of second malignancies for prostate cancer.,"Van Hemelrijck, Mieke; Feller, Anita; Garmo, Hans; Valeri, Fabio; Korol, Dimitri; Dehler, Silvia; Rohrmann, Sabine","INTRODUCTION: There is a need to assess risk of second primary cancers in prostate cancer (PCa) patients, especially since PCa treatment may be associated with increased risk of second primary tumours., METHODS: We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for second primary tumours comparing men diagnosed with PCa between 1980 and 2010 in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (n = 20,559), and the general male population in the Canton., RESULTS: A total of 1,718 men developed a second primary tumour after PCa diagnosis, with lung and colon cancer being the most common (15 and 13% respectively). The SIR for overall second primary cancer was 1.11 (95%CI: 1.06-1.17). Site-specific SIRs varied from 1.19 (1.05-1.34) to 2.89 (2.62-4.77) for lung and thyroid cancer, respectively. When stratified by treatment, the highest SIR was observed for thyroid cancer (3.57 (1.30-7.76)) when undergoing surgery, whereas liver cancer was common when treated with radiotherapy (3.21 (1.54-5.90)) and kidney bladder was most prevalent for those on hormonal treatment (3.15 (1.93-4.87)). Stratification by time since PCa diagnosis showed a lower risk of cancer for men with PCa compared to the general population for the first four years, but then a steep increase in risk was observed., CONCLUSION: In the Canton of Zurich, there was an increased risk of second primary cancers among men with PCa compared to the general population.

A retrospective cohort study was performed using data from the Queensland Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to approximate the relative risk of being diagnosed with another primary cancer either following or prior to MCC. Patients with an eligible first primary MCC (n = 787) had more than double the expected number of subsequent primary cancers (SIR = 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.84-2.60; P<0.001).

Significantly increased bi-directional relative risks were found for melanoma, lip cancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, myelodysplastic diseases, and cancer with unknown primary site. In addition, risks were elevated for female breast cancer and kidney cancer following a first primary MCC, and for subsequent MCCs following first primary colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or lymphoid leukemia.

Mean follow-up time was 31.3 +/- 38.6 mo (range 1-241 mo). The following clinicopathological features of patients with synchronous tumors were compared to those with metachronous tumors: age, sex, symptom duration, family history of cancer, tumor site, stage (early vs advanced), histology, and blood group. GC patients with and without a second tumor were compared in terms of the same clinicopathological features., RESULTS: Of 862 GC patients, 58 (6.7%) developed a total of 62 multiple primary tumors, of which 39 (63%) were metachronous and 23 (37%) synchronous. Four (6.9%) of the 58 multiple GC patients developed two or more neoplasms. The predominant tumor type of the secondary neoplasms was colorectal (n = 17), followed by lung (n = 9), breast (n = 8), and prostate (n = 7).

The researchers of the current study retrospectively evaluated the data from 119 men who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy at four referral institutions in Ankara, Turkey. Of the 21 prostate cancer patients, 17 (81%) were aged >= 60 years; 10 (47.6%) had clinically significant diseases; three had a Gleason score of 6, three had a Gleason score of 7, three had a Gleason score of 8, one had a positive surgical margin along with extracapsular invasion of the tumor and a high Gleason score, and three patients had a tumor volume of >= 0.5 cm(3), of which two also had a high Gleason score. Patients were followed-up for a mean of 29 +/- 10.2 months; the overall survival was 96.6% (n = 115) during that period. Preoperative digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen values did not differ between the benign and prostate cancer groups. There was no survival advantage in the insignificant prostate cancer and benign prostate groups. No additional benefit for predicting prostate cancer was found with digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen tests, although some clinicians advised such. In patients aged < 60 years, organ-sparing cystectomy seems reasonable. In prostate-sparing surgery, candidates who are aged >60 years, the preoperative work-up may routinely include prostate biopsy, especially the apex.

CKD and the risk of incident cancer.,"Lowrance, William T; Ordonez, Juan; Udaltsova, Natalia; Russo, Paul; Go, Alan S","Previous studies report a higher risk of cancer in patients with ESRD, but the impact of less severe CKD on risk of cancer is uncertain. Our objective was to evaluate the association between level of kidney function and subsequent cancer risk. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1,190,538 adults who were receiving care within a health care delivery system, had a measurement of kidney function obtained between 2000 and 2008, and had no prior cancer. We examined the association between level of eGFR and the risk of incident cancer; the primary outcome was renal cancer, and secondary outcomes were any cancer and specific cancers (urothelial, prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal). During 6,000,420 person-years of follow-up, we identified 76,809 incident cancers in 72,875 subjects. After adjustment for time-updated confounders, lower eGFR (in milliliters per minute per 1.73 m(2)) was associated with an increased risk of renal cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.22 to 1.58 for eGFR=45-59; HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.51 to 2.17 for eGFR=30-44; HR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.78 to 2.92 for eGFR<30). We also observed an increased risk of urothelial cancer at eGFR<30 but no significant associations between eGFR and prostate, breast, lung, colorectal, or any cancer overall.

The long survival of patients with this common cancer raises questions about the risk of a second primary cancer and the need for continued surveillance., METHODS: A population-based cohort of 441,504 men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1992 and 2010 was identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER) data (SEER13). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated as an estimate of the risk of a second primary malignancy based on the incidence in the general population., RESULTS: Prostate cancer survivors had a lower risk of being diagnosed with another cancer overall compared with the US population (SIR = 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.61). The risks of leukemia and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, lung and bronchus, and larynx were significantly lower. Conversely, these patients had a greater risk of bladder, kidney, and endocrine and soft tissue cancers. Men who received treatment with radiation therapy (external-beam radiation therapy) had long-term increases in their risk of bladder cancer (SIR = 1.42) and rectal cancer (SIR = 1.70) risk compared with who did not receive radiation (SIRbladder = 0.76; SIRrectal = 0.74). There were significant racial differences in the risk of being diagnosed with a second primary cancer, and the magnitude and direction of these risks depended on tumor type., CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer survivors remain at risk of subsequent malignancies, and race and treatment choice important determinants of long-term risk.

The structural analysis of MARK4 and the exploration of specific inhibitors for the MARK family: a computational approach to obstruct the role of MARK4 in prostate cancer progression.,"Jenardhanan, Pranitha; Mannu, Jayakanthan; Mathur, Premendu P","Prostate cancer, the second most common form of cancer in adult males is generally treated using hormone therapy but the emergence of hormone refractory prostate cancer poses serious challenges to the existing therapeutic strategies. However, protein kinases are now currently identified as potent targets for treating cancer, and MARK4L, a Ser/Thr kinase in the Par-1 family, is one such kinase that is expressed primarily in the testis and is involved in the regulation of spermatid polarity during spermatogenesis. It is also associated with Wnt-induced prostate carcinogenesis, making it a promising target for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics as part of alternative therapies to counter prostate cancer. In the present work, we predicted the three dimensional structure for the kinase domain of MARK4 and analyzed its structural properties. The results illuminate the presence of the unusual DFG Asp-in/alphaC helix-out conformation along with the absence of an additional hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the ATP binding site in its inactive state. These structural features accentuate the need for new specific therapeutics against MARK4. Hence, a robust ligand-based pharmacophore model AARRR.9 was developed based on the three dimensional chemical features of 9-oxo-9H-acridin-10-yl derivatives which possess a high specificity towards MARK kinases. A pharmacophore based search identified six potent compounds with a better specificity and binding efficiency to MARK4 bearing stable interactions with key residues K88, A138, D199 and E106, thereby making them tough ATP competitors. The closure of the catalytic cleft observed in the ligand bound complexes and its independency to the movement of the T-loop makes them promising candidates in hampering the role of MARK4 in prostate cancer.",2014,/,Molecular bioSystems,10,7,1845-68,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3mb70591a,24763618,#2766,Jenardhanan 2014,,

We used National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results and International Agency for Research on Cancer definitions of multiple primary cancers and estimated indirectly standardised incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)., RESULTS: There was a high incidence of cancer during the first 60 days following diagnosis (SIR = 2.36, 95% CI = 2.12 to 2.63). When this period was excluded the risk was not raised, but it was high for some patient groups; in particular women aged <50 years with breast cancer (SIR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.58 to 2.78), patients with bladder (SIR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.67) and head & neck (SIR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.67 to 2.21) cancer. Head & neck cancer patients had increased risks of lung cancer (SIR = 3.75, 95% CI = 3.01 to 4.62), oesophageal (SIR = 4.62, 95% CI = 2.73 to 7.29) and other head & neck tumours (SIR = 6.10, 95% CI = 4.17 to 8.61). Patients with bladder cancer had raised risks of lung (SIR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.62 to 2.88) and prostate (SIR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.72 to 3.30) cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Relative risks of second primary cancers may be smaller than previously reported.

Tadalafil for prevention of erectile dysfunction after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [0831] randomized clinical trial.,"Pisansky, Thomas M; Pugh, Stephanie L; Greenberg, Richard E; Pervez, Nadeem; Reed, Daniel R; Rosenthal, Seth A; Mowat, Rex B; Raben, Adam; Buyyounouski, Mark K; Kachnic, Lisa A; Bruner, Deborah W","IMPORTANCE: Tadalafil is used to treat erectile dysfunction after prostate cancer treatment, but its role as a preventive agent is undefined., OBJECTIVES: To determine primarily whether tadalafil preserved erectile function in men treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer, and secondarily to determine whether participant- or partner-reported overall sexual function and sexual and marital satisfaction were affected., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Stratified, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study with 1:1 randomization at 76 community-based and tertiary medical sites in the United States and Canada. Two hundred forty-two participants with intact erectile function scheduled to receive radiotherapy for prostate cancer were recruited between November 2009 and February 2012 with follow-up through March 2013., INTERVENTIONS: One hundred twenty-one participants were assigned 5 mg of tadalafil daily and 121 were assigned placebo for 24 weeks starting with external radiotherapy (63%) or brachytherapy (37%). Participant -reported International Index of Erectile Function response before radiotherapy and at weeks 2 and 4, between weeks 20 and 24, between weeks 28 and 30, and 1 year thereafter. Participants and partners could respond also to the Sexual Adjustment Questionnaire and to the Locke Marital Adjustment Test before radiotherapy, between weeks 20 and 24 and weeks 28 and 30, and at 1 year., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was off-drug spontaneous erectile function 28 to 30 weeks after radiotherapy started. Secondary end points were spontaneous erection at 1 year; overall sexual function and satisfaction; marital adjustment; and partner-reported satisfaction and marital adjustment at 28 to 30 weeks and 1 year, predictors of tadalafil response; and adverse events., RESULTS: Among 221 evaluable participants, 80 (79%; 95% CI, 70%-88%) assigned to receive tadalafil retained erectile function between weeks 28 and 30 compared with 61 (74%; 95% CI, 63%-85%) assigned to receive placebo (P = .49); an absolute difference of 5% (95% CI, -9% to 19%). A significant difference was also not observed at 1 year (72%; 95% CI, 60%-84% vs 71%; 95% CI, 59%-84%; P = .93). Tadalafil was not associated with significantly improved overall sexual function or satisfaction; a significant difference was not observed in any domain subscale. Partners of men assigned tadalafil noted no significant effect on sexual satisfaction, and marital adjustment was not significantly improved in participants or partners., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among men undergoing radiotherapy for prostate cancer, daily use of tadalafil compared with placebo did not result in improved erectile function. These findings do not support daily use of tadalafil to prevent erectile dysfunction in these patients., TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00931528.",2014,/,JAMA,311,13,1300-7,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2014.2626,24691606,#2768,Pisansky 2014,,
Adherence to performance measures and outcomes among men treated for prostate cancer.,"Schroeck, Florian R; Kaufman, Samuel R; Jacobs, Bruce L; Skolarus, Ted A; Miller, David C; Montgomery, Jeffrey S; Weizer, Alon Z; Hollenbeck, Brent K","PURPOSE: We assessed the relationship between health care system performance on nationally endorsed prostate cancer quality of care measures and prostate cancer treatment outcomes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 48,050 men from SEER-Medicare linked data diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2004 and 2009, and followed through 2010. Based on a composite quality measure we categorized the health care systems in which these men were treated into 1-star (bottom 20%), 2-star (middle 60%) and 3-star (top 20%) systems. We then examined the association of health care system level quality of care with outcomes using multivariable logistic and Cox regression., RESULTS: Patients who underwent prostatectomy in 3-star vs 1-star health care systems were at lower risk for perioperative complications (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-1.00). However, they were more likely to undergo a procedure addressing treatment related morbidity, eg for sexual morbidity (11.3% vs 7.8%, p = 0.043). In patients who received radiotherapy star ranking was not associated with treatment related morbidity. In all patients star ranking was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84-1.15) or secondary cancer therapy (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91-1.20)., CONCLUSIONS: We found no consistent association between health care system quality and outcomes, which questions how meaningful these measures ultimately are for patients. Thus, future studies should focus on developing more discriminative quality measures. Copyright © 2014 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A combined index to classify prognostic comorbidity in candidates for radical prostatectomy.,"Froehner, Michael; Kellner, Anna-Elisa; Koch, Rainer; Baretton, Gustavo B; Hakenberg, Oliver W; Wirth, Manfred P","BACKGROUND: In patients with early prostate cancer, stratification by comorbidity could be of importance in clinical decision making as well as in characterizing patients enrolled into clinical trials. In this study, we investigated several comorbidity classifications as predictors of overall mortality after radical prostatectomy, searching for measures providing complementary prognostic information which could be combined into a single score., METHODS: The study sample consisted of 2205 consecutive patients selected for radical prostatectomy with a mean age of 64 years and a mean follow-up of 9.2 years (median: 8.6). Seventy-four patients with incomplete tumor-related data were excluded. In addition to age and tumor-related parameters, six comorbidity classifications and the body mass index were assessed as possible predictors of overall mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves and Mantel-Haenszel hazard ratios were used for univariate analysis. The impact of different causes of death was analyzed by competing risk analysis. Cox proportional hazard models were calculated to analyze combined effects of variables., RESULTS: Age, Gleason score, tumor stage, Charlson score, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class and body mass index were identified a significant predictors of overall mortality in the multivariate analysis regardless whether two-sided and three-sided stratifications were used. Competing risk analysis revealed that the excess mortality in patients with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or higher was attributable to competing mortality including second cancers, but not to prostate cancer mortality., CONCLUSION: Stratifying patients by a combined consideration of the comorbidity measures Charlson score, ASA classification and body mass index may assist clinical decision making in elderly candidates for radical prostatectomy.",2014,/,BMC urology,14,100968571,28,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2490-14-28,24678762,#2770,Froehner 2014,,
"Multiple primary tumors following stage II and III rectal cancer in patients receiving radiotherapy, 1998-2010.","Smith-Gagen, Julie; Goodwin, George A 3rd; Tay, Jonathan","OBJECTIVE: This report investigated the impact of radiation therapy among stage II/III rectal cancer patients who were resected for cure and then developed second primary cancer., METHODS: The analysis included patients diagnosed with rectal cancer from 1992 to 2010 and who were registered in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Standardized incidence ratios assessed the location of second primary cancers by the receipt and sequence of radiation therapy. A Cox proportional hazards model examined the predictors for patients who developed second primary cancers., RESULTS: The hazard ratio for developing any type of second primary was 12 % higher in patients receiving preoperative radiotherapy, Hazard Ratio and 95 % confidence interval, HR 95 % CI 1.12 (1.0, 1.2), and 33 % lower for patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy, HR 95 % CI 0.75 (0.7, 0.8), relative to patients who did not receive radiation therapy. The location of the second cancer varied by both the receipt and sequence of radiation therapy. Secondary rectal cancers were reduced 170 % after postoperative radiation and 103 % after preoperative radiation, compared to the non-receipt of radiation therapy. The impact of radiation therapy on secondary colon cancers was not as marked. Rectal cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy are at a higher risk of thyroid cancers and leukemia, but males have a lower risk of prostate cancer., CONCLUSIONS: While preoperative radiation therapy is advantageous for reducing rectal cancer recurrence, this study identifies advantages of postoperative radiation for reducing second primary cancers.

Characteristics of lung cancer after a previous malignancy.,"Reinmuth, Niels; Stumpf, Patrick; Stumpf, Andreas; Muley, Thomas; Kobinger, Sonja; Hoffmann, Hans; Herth, Felix J F; Schnabel, Philipp A; Bischoff, Helge; Thomas, Michael","BACKGROUND: In the era of improving overall survival rates of malignant diseases, the impact of a previous malignancy (PM) on treatment and outcome of lung cancer (LC) remains unclear., METHODS: We reviewed all LC patients from our institution that were treated from 2004 to 2006 for the occurrence of LC with PM excluding patients with multiple primary LC., RESULTS: A total of 444 and 2698 LC patients with and without a history of a PM were identified (prevalence of 14.1%). PM were most often located in breast (15.5%), prostate (14.9%), bladder (9.0%) and kidney (8.8%). Compared to never smokers, patients with nicotine consumption had more often a cancer history of prostate, gastrointestinal, and the head-neck region. The median interval until diagnosis of LC was 72.2 months (range 0-537 months) with most LC diagnosed 5 years after PM diagnosis. With a similar distribution of histology, stage and localization compared to controls, NSCLC patients with PM and stage IV disease showed a favorable overall survival (p < 0.0001). In contrast, SCLC patients had similar survival curves (n.s.)., CONCLUSIONS: A considerable subgroup of LC patients has a history of PM that may indicate a favorable prognostic factor. However, these patients should be treated similar to other LC patients. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

New malignancies after squamous cell carcinoma and melanomas: a population-based study from Norway.,"Robsahm, Trude E; Karagas, Margaret R; Rees, Judy R; Syse, Astri","BACKGROUND: Skin cancer survivors experience an increased risk for subsequent malignancies but the associated risk factors are poorly understood. This study examined the risk of a new primary cancer following an initial skin cancer and assessed risk factors associated with second primary cancers., METHODS: All invasive cutaneous malignant melanomas (CMM, N = 28 069) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC, N = 24 620) diagnosed in Norway during 1955-2008 were included. Rates of new primary cancers in skin cancer survivors were compared to rates of primary malignancies in the general population using standardized incidence ratios (SIR). Discrete-time logistic regression models were applied to individual-level data to estimate cancer risk among those with and without a prior skin cancer, accounting for residential region, education, income, parenthood, marital status and parental cancer status, using a 20% random sample of the entire Norwegian population as reference. Further analyses of the skin cancer cohort were undertaken to determine risk factors related to subsequent cancers., RESULTS: During follow-up, 9608 new primary cancers occurred after an initial skin cancer. SIR analyses showed 50% and 90% increased risks for any cancer after CMM and SCC, respectively (p < 0.01). The logistic regression model suggested even stronger increase after SCC (130%). The highest risk was seen for subsequent skin cancers, but several non-skin cancers were also diagnosed in excess: oral, lung, colon, breast, prostate, thyroid, leukemia, lymphoma and central nervous system. Factors that were associated with increased risk of subsequent cancers include male sex, older age, lower residential latitude, being married and low education and income. Parental cancer did not increase the risk of a subsequent cancer after SCC, but was a significant predictor among younger CMM survivors., CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide information on shared environmental and genetic risk factors for first and later cancers and may help to identify individuals at high risk for subsequent cancers, which will be important as skin cancer incidence continues to rise.",2014,/,BMC cancer,14,100967800,210,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-14-210,24645632,#2773,Robsahm 2014,,
Co-occurrence of second primary malignancy in patients with thyroid cancer.,"Hsu, C-H; Huang, C-L; Hsu, Y-H; Iqbal, U; Nguyen, P-A; Jian, W-S","BACKGROUND: The discovery of asynchronous or synchronous double or multiple malignancies in patients is not uncommon. The co-occurrence of second primary malignancy (SPM) could be randomly occurring or association with risk factors such as environmental, genetic predisposition and therapy-related., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved ~782 million claim records consisting of 10.8 million males and 10.6 million females from Taiwan's National Health Insurance, which were collected for a period of 3 years (January 2000-December 2002). All the patient records were stratified by gender and ages at a 20-year interval with SPMs and specific groups. Interestingness or Q-value was used to measure strength of the disease-disease associations., RESULTS: A total of 9423 thyroid cancer (female: 7483, male: 1940), 276 184 SPM (female: 141 023, male: 135 161) and 861 co-occurrence cases (female: 583, male: 278) were recorded. The co-occurrence incidence rate of head and neck, breast, digestive system and lung was 1.93%, 1.59%, 1.44% and 1.18%, respectively. Malignancy of salivary glands, laryngx, sarcoma, lymphoid tissue, mouth, central nervous system and lungs found Q-value >10. Malignancies with intermediate Q-values (5.0-9.9) were observed in nasopharynx, kidney and ureter, breast, stomach and skin. Prostate, leukemia, urinary bladder, ovary, colon, liver and uterine cervix cancer have lower Q-values (1.0-4.9)., CONCLUSION: Co-occurrence ratio of thyroid cancer and SPM was high, occurred in all organ systems. We postulated that the aggressive use of modern diagnostic modalities, aggressive radioiodine treatment, pre-existing molecular oncogen mutations, and thyroid hormone for simultaneously supple-mentary and suppressive therapies were responsible.

"Age-time risk patterns of solid cancers in 60 901 non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivors from Finland, Norway and Sweden.","Lorenzo Bermejo, Justo; Pukkala, Eero; Johannesen, Tom B; Sundquist, Jan; Hemminki, Kari","Survival after non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has increased thanks to improved treatment but NHL survivors have an increased risk of second neoplasms. The assessment of cancer risk patterns after NHL may help to quantify the late side-effects of therapy. Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and absolute incidence rates for nine solid tumours based on a nationwide cohort of 60 901 NHL survivors from Finland, Norway and Sweden. Patients were diagnosed between 1980 and 2006 and developed 6815 s neoplasms. NHL patients showed an increased risk of each of the nine investigated cancer sites: prostate and pancreas (both RRs 1.28), breast (1.37), colorectum (1.48), urinary bladder (1.52), stomach and lung (both RRs 1.87), skin (melanoma 2.27) and kidney (2.56). The RRs showed a U-shaped relationship with time after NHL for all nine-second cancer types. NHL diagnosis early in life was a risk factor for the development of second cancers with the exception of melanoma, but a risk excess was even observed in patients diagnosed with NHL at age 80+ years. The present study provides accurate estimates on the adverse late effects of NHL therapy, which should guide the establishment of cancer prevention strategies in NHL survivors.

Second primary cancers occurring after I-125 brachytherapy as monotherapy for early prostate cancer.,"Musunuru, H; Mason, M; Murray, L; Al-Qaisieh, B; Bownes, P; Smith, J; Franks, K; Carey, B; Bottomley, D; Henry, A M","AIMS: Prostate brachytherapy may be associated with a lower risk of radiation-induced second primary cancer (SPC) as a significantly smaller volume of normal tissue is irradiated when compared with external beam techniques. Limited data are available as it has been a routine treatment option for less than 20 years. This study identified cases of SPC in patients who underwent I-125 prostate brachytherapy as monotherapy in a single institution., MATERIALS AND METHODS: SPC incidence was retrieved by conducting a UK cancer registry search (Northern and Yorkshire Cancer Registry and Information Service) for 1805 consecutive patients with localised prostate cancer who received monotherapy with I-125 brachytherapy from 1995 to 2006 at a single public hospital. Of 1730 UK residents, the completeness of the registry match was 91% (1574 patients). The mean age at treatment (interquartile range) of the cohort was 63 (58-68) years with 1100 patients (70%) over the age of 60 years at treatment. The median (range) follow-up was 8 (6-10) years with 487 patients (31%) having 10 years or more., RESULTS: In total, 170 patients (10.8%) were diagnosed with second primaries (1 year or more after implant); 20 of these were bladder and 10 rectal cancers. The 10 year cumulative incidences were 14.6, 1 and 0.84% for any second malignancy, bladder and rectal cancer, respectively. Only the standardised incidence rate (SIR) for bladder cancer was higher at 1.54 (95% confidence interval 0.96-2.46) compared with the general population. The SIR for bladder cancer was higher in the first few years after treatment, suggesting that the increased incidence of bladder cancer is due to increased urological surveillance., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the incidence of SPC after I-125 is comparable with other published data with no significant excess more than 5 years from treatment.

"Preoperative findings, pathological stage PSA recurrence in men with prostate cancer incidentally detected at radical cystectomy: our experience in 242 cases.","Pepe, Pietro; Fraggetta, Filippo; Galia, Antonio; Panella, Paolo; Pennisi, Michele; Colecchia, Maurizio; Aragona, Francesco","PURPOSE: Preoperative findings, pathological stage PSA recurrence in patients with prostate cancer incidentally detected (iPCa) at radical cystectomy (RCP) were prospectively evaluated., METHODS: From July 2000 to July 2013, 242 men 71 years old (median) underwent RCP; preoperatively, all patients underwent digital rectal examination (DRE), total and free/total PSA. The bladder was totally examined; moreover, the prostate gland was step-sectioned at 4-mm intervals. The incidence of iPCa that fulfilled criteria for clinically significant iPCa was recorded: tumor volume >=0.5 mL, Gleason grade >=4, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node metastasis or positive surgical margins. In the presence of iPCa, the patients underwent PSA evaluation during the follow-up and recurrence was defined as two subsequent rises >0.2 ng/mL., RESULTS: Among the 50 (20.6%) out of 242 patients submitted to RCP, an iPCa was found and 18 (36%) of them met criteria for insignificant iPCa; moreover, 30% of the patients had apex involvement. Median total PSA and PSA F/T values were not significantly different in the presence versus the absence of iPCa (2.6 vs 2.7 ng/mL and 26 vs 27%; p > 0.05) and between significant versus insignificant iPCa (p > 0.05). None of the patients during the follow-up (median 58 months; range 6-102 months) had PSA recurrence., CONCLUSIONS: PSA and PSA F/T values are provided for poor accuracy in distinguishing preoperatively significant from insignificant iPCa; however, the life expectancy of the patients is dramatically influenced by bladder cancer pTN (in our series, none developed PSA failure). In younger men in whom a prostate-sparing cystectomy could be proposed, an accurate preoperative evaluation should be mandatory to rule out significant iPCa at the risk of apex involvement (in our series equal to 30% of the cases).",2014,/,International urology and nephrology,46,7,1325-8,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11255-014-0647-8,24488687,#2777,Pepe 2014,,
Incidence of complications other than urinary incontinence or erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a population-based cohort study.,"Nam, Robert K; Cheung, Patrick; Herschorn, Sender; Saskin, Refik; Su, Jiandong; Klotz, Laurence H; Chang, Michelle; Kulkarni, Girish S; Lee, Yuna; Kodama, Ronald T; Narod, Steven A","BACKGROUND: Studies of complications resulting from surgery or radiotherapy for prostate cancer have mainly focused on incontinence and erectile dysfunction. We aimed to assess other important complications associated with these treatments for prostate cancer., METHODS: We did a population-based retrospective cohort study, in which we used administrative hospital data, physician billing codes, and cancer registry data for men who underwent either surgery or radiotherapy alone for prostate cancer between 2002 and 2009 in Ontario, Canada. We measured the 5-year cumulative incidence of five treatment-related complication endpoints: hospital admissions; urological, rectal, or anal procedures; open surgical procedures; and secondary malignancies., FINDINGS: In the 32 465 patients included in the study, the 5-year cumulative incidence of admission to hospital for a treatment-related complication was 22.2% (95% CI 21.7-22.7), but was 2.4% (2.2-2.6) for patients whose length of stay was longer than 1 day. The 5-year cumulative incidence of needing a urological procedure was 32.0% (95% CI 31.4-32.5), that of a rectal or anal procedure was 13.7% (13.3-14.1), and that of an open surgical procedure was 0.9% (0.8-1.1). The 5-year cumulative incidence of a second primary malignancy was 3.0% (2.6-3.5). These risks were significantly higher than were those of 32 465 matched controls with no history of prostate cancer. Older age and comorbidity at the time of index treatment were important predictors for a complication in all outcome categories, but the type of treatment received was the strongest predictor for complications. Patients who were given radiotherapy had higher incidence of complications for hospital admissions, rectal or anal procedures, open surgical procedures, and secondary malignancies at 5 years than did those who underwent surgery (adjusted hazard ratios 2.08-10.8, p<0.0001). However, the number of urological procedures was lower in the radiotherapy than in the surgery group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.63-0.69; p<0.0001) INTERPRETATION: Complications after prostate cancer treatment are frequent and dependent on age, comorbidity, and the type of treatment.

"Health status and health resource use among long-term survivors of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer.","Ferro, Tarsila; Aliste, Luisa; Valverde, Montserrat; Fernandez, M Paz; Ballano, Concepcion; Borras, Josep M","INTRODUCTION: The growing number of long-term cancer survivors poses a new challenge to health care systems. In Spain, follow-up is usually carried out in oncology services, but knowledge of cancer survivors' health care needs in this context is limited. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the health status of long-term survivors of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer and to characterize their use of health care services., METHODS: Retrospective multicenter cohort study. We collected data from patients' clinical histories and through telephone interviews, using a specially designed questionnaire that included the SF-36v2 Quality of Life and Nottingham Health Profile scales., RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 51.2% (n= 583) of the potential sample. No significant differences were observed between 5-year and 10-year survivors. Overall, more than 80% of respondents were undergoing drug treatment for morbidity related to advanced age. Quality of life was good in most patients, and cancer-related morbidity was low and of little complexity. For the most part, participants reported using primary care services for care of chronic diseases and opportunistic treatment of sequelae related to the cancer treatment. Oncological follow-up was centralized at the hospital., CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of breast, prostate and colorectal cancer with tumoral detection at an early stage and without recurrences or second neoplasms experienced little morbidity and enjoyed good quality of life. This study proposes exploration of a follow-up model in the Spanish health system in which primary care plays a more important role than is customary in cancer survivors in Spain.

"Increased risk of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia among cancer survivors in the Netherlands: increased detection, causal factors or both?.","van den Broek, E C; Liu, L; Posthuma, E F M; Janssen-Heijnen, M L G; Coebergh, J W W; Soerjomataram, I","We assessed the risk of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) following earlier primary malignancies (EPM) to explore the extent and determinants of this risk. We used the Netherlands Cancer Registry data of 1,313,232 cancer survivors who were at risk to be subsequently diagnosed with CLL between 1989 and 2008. Cancer survivors were categorized based on gender, age, time since diagnosis of EPM and type of EPM. CLL was regarded synchronous when diagnosed within 3 months after diagnosis of EPM; metachronous CLLs were those diagnosed later. Overall, we found that cancer survivors had a 90 % higher risk to be diagnosed with CLL than the general population. In the first year after diagnosis, we found a more than four-fold increased risk of CLL (standardized incidence ratio (SIR), 4.4; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 4.1-4.8); however, no increased risk was observed after excluding synchronous cases. After 1 year, the excess risk of subsequent CLL ranged from 1.2 to 1.8. An increased risk for metachronous CLL was found in prostate (SIR 1.3; 95 % CI 1.1-1.5) and squamous cell skin cancer survivors (SIR 2.3; 95 % CI 1.9-2.7). Intensive clinical checkups after/around diagnosis of the EPM seemed to be the main cause for the increased risk of CLL among cancer survivors. However, possible shared risk factors between prostate cancer and CLL and skin cancer and CLL cannot be excluded.

Recent progress on nutraceutical research in prostate cancer.,"Li, Yiwei; Ahmad, Aamir; Kong, Dejuan; Bao, Bin; Sarkar, Fazlul H","Recently, nutraceuticals have received increasing attention as the agents for cancer prevention and supplement with conventional therapy. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the US. Growing evidences from epidemiological studies, in vitro experimental studies, animal studies, and clinical trials have shown that nutraceuticals could be very useful for the prevention and treatment of PCa. Several nutraceuticals including isoflavone, indole-3-carbinol, 3,3'-diindolylmethane, lycopene, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and curcumin are known to downregulate the signal transductions in AR, Akt, NF-kappaB, and other signal transduction pathways which are vital for the development of PCa and the progression of PCa from androgen-sensitive to castrate-resistant PCa. Therefore, nutraceutical treatment in combination with conventional therapeutics could achieve better treatment outcome in prostate cancer therapy. Interestingly, some nutraceuticals could regulate the function of cancer stem cell (CSC)-related miRNAs and associated molecules, leading to the inhibition of prostatic CSCs which are responsible for drug resistance, tumor progression, and recurrence of PCa. Hence, nutraceuticals may serve as powerful agents for the prevention of PCa progression and they could also be useful in combination with chemotherapeutics or radiotherapy. Such strategy could become a promising newer approach for the treatment of metastatic PCa with better treatment outcome by improving overall survival.",2014,/,Cancer metastasis reviews,33,03-Feb,629-40,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10555-013-9478-9,24375392,#2781,Li 2014,,
The prevalence of persistent prostate cancer after radiotherapy detected at radical cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer.,"Meeks, Joshua J; Kern, Sean Q; Dalbagni, Guido; Eastham, James A; Sandhu, Jaspreet S","PURPOSE: More than half of the men who receive treatment for prostate cancer elect radiotherapy. After radiotherapy recurrence is determined by an increase in prostate specific antigen and not usually by pathological confirmation. We describe the prevalence of persistent gradable prostate cancer in men treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer at radical cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 78 patients underwent radiotherapy (brachytherapy and/or external beam radiation) before the development of bladder cancer requiring radical cystectomy at our institution. All tissues were evaluated by a specialized genitourinary pathologist., RESULTS: Median time from radiotherapy to radical cystoprostatectomy was 77 months. Gradable prostate cancer was identified in 45% of patients. Of the tumors 69% were Gleason score 7 or greater, 17% were pT3 or greater and 5% showed positive lymph nodes. Men treated more recently were less likely to have gradable prostate cancer, including 100% before 1980, 49% between 1980 and 2000 and 10% from 2000 to the present (p=0.002) as were those who received external beam radiation alone compared to brachytherapy and combined brachytherapy/external beam radiation (58% vs 27% and 14%, respectively, p=0.005)., CONCLUSIONS: After radiotherapy 45% of men had persistent prostate cancer (37% of men with no evidence of disease). A decreased prostate cancer rate was associated with later treatment year and combined brachytherapy/external beam radiation regimens. Similar to men treated with radical cystoprostatectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer, meticulous attention should be paid during prostate removal in men treated with radiotherapy because many may have persistent prostate cancer. In addition, markers other than prostate specific antigen should be studied in men treated with radiotherapy to better identify those with biochemical recurrence.

Multiple myeloma and other malignancies: a pilot study from the Houston VA.,"Munker, Reinhold; Shi, Runhua; Lin, Derek; Guo, Shan; Hayes, Teresa G","BACKGROUND: The prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM) has improved in recent years. Therefore, second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) may become an issue for longer term survivors with MM. An increased incidence of second malignancies was reported in patients who received lenalidomide for relapsed or refractory myeloma., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from the Tumor Registry of the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (1995-2010) were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival statistics were calculated., RESULTS: In 197 patients with MM, 39 different cancers were observed in 33 patients, the large majority occurring before the diagnosis of MM, with most being early-stage or good-prognosis malignancies. Despite this, the prognosis of patients with a second or third cancer was clearly inferior to patients without other cancers. Notable was a significant number of prostate cancers as preexisting malignancies., CONCLUSION: At present, most other cancers (for which MM is the secondary malignancy) may not be related to the treatment for myeloma, but due to underlying immunologic, genetic, or environmental factors. Larger studies and careful follow-up, especially in good-risk patients treated with novel agents, are indicated.

An incidence model of the cost of advanced prostate cancer in Spain.,"Hart, W M; Nazir, J; Baskin-Bey, E","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cancer diagnosed among men. In Spain the incidence of PCa was 70.75 cases per 100,000 males. Advanced PCa has spread outside of the prostate capsule and may involve other parts of the body. The aim of this study was to estimate the lifetime costs of a cohort of advanced PCa patients diagnosed in Spain in 2012., METHODS: A partitioned economic model was developed in EXCEL incorporating Spanish incidence, mortality, and cost data supplemented with data from the international literature. Progression from Stage III to Stage IV was permitted. Costs were discounted at the standard rate of 3%. Lifetime costs were presented on an individual basis and for the entire cohort of newly diagnosed Stage III and Stage IV PCa patients., RESULTS: Lifetime costs for advanced PCa were ~19,961 per patient (mean survival of 8.4 years). Using the projected incident cases for 2012 (3047), the total cost for the incident cohort of patients in 2012 would amount to 61 million. These results were more sensitive to changes in the ongoing costs (post-initial 12 months) of Stage III PCa, the rate of progression from Stage III to Stage IV, and the discount rate applied to costs., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an estimate of the lifetime costs of advanced PCa in Spain and a framework for further research. The study is limited by the availability of long-term Spanish data and the need to make inferences from international studies. However, until long-term prospective or observational data do become available in Spain, based on the assumptions, the current results indicate that the burden of advanced PCa in Spain is substantial. Any treatments that could potentially reduce the economic burden of the disease should be of interest to healthcare decision makers.",2014,/,Journal of medical economics,17,2,125-31,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3111/13696998.2013.877020,24350997,#2784,Hart 2014,,
"Positive surgical margins: rate, contributing factors and impact on further treatment: findings from the Prostate Cancer Registry.","Evans, Sue M; Millar, Jeremy L; Frydenberg, Mark; Murphy, Declan G; Davis, Ian D; Spelman, Tim; Bolton, Damien M; Giles, Graham G; Dean, Joanne; Costello, Anthony J; Frauman, Albert G; Kearns, Paul A; Day, Laura; Daniels, Christopher; McNeill, John J","OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of patients with and without positive surgical margins (PSMs) and to analyse the impact of PSMs on secondary cancer treatment after radical prostatectomy (RP), with short-term follow-up., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed data from 2385 consecutive patients treated using RP, who were notified to the Prostate Cancer Registry by 37 hospitals in Victoria, Australia between August 2008 and February 2012. Independent and multivariate models were constructed to predict the likelihood of PSMs. Independent and multivariate predictors of secondary treatment after RP in the initial 12 months after diagnosis were also assessed., RESULTS: Data on PSM status were collected for 2219/2385 (93%) patients. In total 592/2175 (27.2%) RPs resulted in PSMs; 102/534 (19.1%) in the low-risk group, 317/1218 (26.0%) in the intermediate-risk group, 153/387 (39.5%) in the high-risk group, and 9/11 (81.8%) in the very-high-risk disease group of patients. Patients having surgery in a hospital where <10 RPs occur each year were significantly more likely to have a PSM (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.93) and those in the intermediate-, high- or very-high-risk groups (IRR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09-1.65, P = 0.007, IRR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.45, P < 0.001 and IRR 3.81, 95% CI 2.60-5.60, P < 0.001, respectively) were significantly more likely to have a PSM than those in the low-risk group (IRR 2.50, 95% CI 1.23-5.11, P = 0.012). Patients with PSMs were significantly less likely to have been treated at a private hospital than a public hospital (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.93, P = 0.006) or to have undergone robot-assisted RP (IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.87; P = 0.002) than open RP. Of the 2182 patients who underwent RP in the initial 12 months after diagnosis, 1987 (91.1%) received no subsequent treatment, 123 (5.6%) received radiotherapy, 47 (2.1%) received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and 23 (1.1%) received a combination of radiotherapy and ADT. Two patients (0.1%) received chemotherapy combined with another treatment. At a multivariate level, predictors of additional treatment after RP in the initial 12 months included having a PSM compared with a negative surgical margin (odds ratio [OR] 5.61, 95% CI 3.82-8.22, P < 0.001); pT3 compared with pT2 disease (OR 4.72, 95% CI 2.69-8.23, P < 0.001); and having high- or very-high-risk disease compared with low-risk disease (OR 4.36, 95% CI 2.24-8.50, P < 0.001 and OR 4.50, 95% CI 1.34-15.17, P = 0.015, respectively). Patient age, hospital location and hospital type were not associated with secondary treatment. Patients undergoing robot-assisted RP were significantly less likely to receive additional treatment than those receiving open RP (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39-0.88, P = 0.010)., CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate an important association between hospital status and PSMs, with patients who underwent RP in private hospitals less likely than those in public hospitals to have a PSM. Patients treated in lower-volume hospitals were more likely to have a PSM and less likely to receive additional treatment after surgery in the initial 12 months, and robot-assisted RP was associated with fewer PSMs than was open RP in this non-randomized observational study. PSM status and pathological T3 disease are both important and independent predictors of secondary cancer treatment for patients undergoing RP. A robot-assisted RP approach appears to decrease the likelihood of subsequent treatment, when compared with the open approach. Copyright © 2013 The Authors.

Urothelial carcinoma involving the prostate: the association of revised tumour stage and coexistent bladder cancer with survival after radical cystectomy.,"Knoedler, John J; Boorjian, Stephen A; Tollefson, Matthew K; Cheville, John C; Thapa, Prabin; Tarrell, Robert F; Frank, Igor","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate survival among patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC) within the prostate in order to assess the impact of depth of tumour invasion as well as the importance of a concurrent bladder tumour., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 201 patients who underwent radical cystectomy (RC) between 1980 and 2006 and were found to have UC involving the prostate. All specimens were re-reviewed by a genitourinary pathologist. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Cox hazard regression models tested the association of clinicopathological variables with outcome., RESULTS: In all, 93 patients had pTis disease in the prostate, 43 had pT2 tumours, and 66 patients were pT4a. The median follow-up was 10.5 years. The 5-year cancer-specific survival for patients with pTis, pT2, and pT4a prostate UC was 73%, 57%, and 21% respectively (P < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, higher prostate tumour stage (hazard ratio [HR] 2.09; P = 0.01), positive lymph node status (HR 2.09; P = 0.002), and concurrent >=pT3 bladder cancer (HR 4.16; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with an increased risk of death from UC., CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with prostatic UC involvement, depth of tumour invasion was significantly associated with cancer-specific mortality, validating the staging reclassification. Concurrent locally advanced bladder cancer also negatively impacted survival, suggesting the potential prognostic value of reporting a secondary tumour stage in such cases.

Second malignancies in long-term testicular cancer survivors.,"Ondrus, D; Ondrusova, M; Friedova, L","PURPOSE: The objective of the present study is to analyze long-term testicular cancer (TC) survivors focusing on the correlation of therapeutic modalities used, the age of patients and second malignancy (SM) occurrence., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1,367 patients with TC and different subsequent therapeutic procedures were followed up between 1970 and 2012. The occurrence of SM was analyzed by standard incidence ratios (SIR). SM occurred in 96 (7.0 %) patients with primary TC., RESULTS: The most frequent SM was TC (SIR 27.4, n = 64); a significantly higher occurrence was observed after primary testicular seminoma. Prostate cancer appeared in 10 patients (SIR 5.2), with a mean age 54.9 years, while the typical age of patients in Slovakia was 71.4 years. Kidney cancer developed in 6 patients, a significant higher SIR was registered only after primary non-seminomas. The mean patient's age was 48.5 years, while the typical age of all male patients in Slovakia was 62.4 years. Other SM had no significantly higher SIR. Colorectal cancer appeared in 8 patients with primary TC, with a mean age 56.0 years, while the typical age of male patients with primary colorectal cancer in Slovakia was 67.1 years. Other non-testicular tumors appeared in 8 patients. SM occurs in 1.5 % of patients following orchiectomy alone, in 4.3 % following radiotherapy, 5.0 % following chemotherapy and in 4.4 % following combined chemo-radiotherapy., CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary analyses indicate increased SM occurrence in patients with primary TC in comparison with the general population, and it also occurs in younger age at the time of SM diagnosis.",2014,/,International urology and nephrology,46,4,749-56,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11255-013-0554-4,24096370,#2787,Ondrus 2014,,

To fill this gap, investigators often use administrative codes for secondary malignant neoplasm or chemotherapy to identify recurrent cases in population-based datasets. However, these algorithms have not been validated in large, contemporary, routine care cohorts., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes as indicators of recurrence after definitive local therapy for stage I-III lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer., RESEARCH DESIGN, SUBJECTS, AND MEASURES: We assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) of these codes 14 and 60 months after diagnosis using 2 administrative datasets linked with gold-standard recurrence status information: CanCORS/Medicare (diagnoses 2003-2005) and HMO/Cancer Research Network (diagnoses 2000-2005)., RESULTS: We identified 929 CanCORS/Medicare patients and 5298 HMO/CRN patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and PPV ranged widely depending on which codes were included and the type of cancer. For patients with lung, colorectal, and breast cancer, the combination of secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes was the most sensitive (75%-85%); no code-set was highly sensitive and highly specific. For prostate cancer, no code-set offered even moderate sensitivity (<= 19%)., CONCLUSIONS: Secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes could not identify recurrent cancer without some risk of misclassification.

PTEN losses exhibit heterogeneity in multifocal prostatic adenocarcinoma and are associated with higher Gleason grade.,"Yoshimoto, Maisa; Ding, Keyue; Sweet, Joan M; Ludkovski, Olga; Trottier, Greg; Song, Kyu S; Joshua, Anthony M; Fleshner, Neil E; Squire, Jeremy A; Evans, Andrew J","Prostatic adenocarcinoma is an epithelial malignancy characterized by marked histological heterogeneity. It most often has a multifocal distribution within the gland, and different Gleason grades may be present within different foci. Data from our group and others have shown that the genomic deletion of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene and the disruption of the ETS gene family have a central role in prostate cancer and are likely to be associated with Gleason grade. In this study, prostate cancer samples were systematically analyzed to determine whether there was concordance between PTEN losses and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion rearrangements, within or between foci in multifocal disease, using well-annotated tissue microarrays (TMAs) consisting of 724 cores derived from 142 radical prostatectomy specimens. Three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of both the PTEN deletion and the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was used to precisely map genetic heterogeneity, both within and between tumor foci represented on the TMA. PTEN deletion was observed in 56 of 134 (42%) patients (hemizygous=42 and homozygous=14). TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was observed in 63 of 139 (45%) patients. When analyzed by Gleason pattern for a given TMA core, PTEN deletions were significantly associated with Gleason grades 4 or 5 over grade 3 (P<0.001). Although TMPRSS2-ERG fusions showed a strong relationship with PTEN deletions (P=0.007), TMPRSS2-ERG fusions did not show correlation with Gleason grade. The pattern of genetic heterogeneity of PTEN deletion was more diverse than that observed for TMPRSS2-ERG fusions in multifocal disease. However, the marked interfocal discordance for both TMPRSS2-ERG fusions and PTEN deletions was consistent with the concept that multiple foci of prostate cancer arise independently within the same prostate, and that individual tumor foci can have distinct patterns of genetic rearrangements.",2013,/,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",26,3,435-47,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/modpathol.2012.162,23018874,#2790,Yoshimoto 2013,,

A population-based comparison of second primary cancers in Germany and Sweden between 1997 and 2006: clinical implications and etiologic aspects.,"Liu, Hao; Hemminki, Kari; Sundquist, Jan; Holleczek, Bernd; Katalinic, Alexander; Emrich, Katharina; Jansen, Lina; Brenner, Hermann","Second primary cancer (SPC) has become an increasing concern in cancer survivorship. Patterns of SPCs in different populations may offer clinical implications and research priorities into SPCs. This study is devoted to compare the occurrences and rank correlations of SPCs between Germany and Sweden. Patients diagnosed with 10 common first primaries between 1997 and 2006 from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database and 10 German cancer registries were included in this population-based study. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the strength of the relationship of SPCs between the German and Swedish datasets. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients suggested a strong positive correlation between the German and Swedish datasets based on the ranks of thirty possible SPCs after all selected first cancers. This was also true when we compared the rankings and proportions of the five most common SPCs after site-specific first primaries between the two populations. For kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and leukemia the components of the five most common SPCs was exactly the same. Also, the ranking and the proportions for the three most common SPCs (i.e., colorectal, bladder, and lung cancers) after prostate cancer were identical in the two populations, as were those after most other primary cancers. The strikingly consistent patterns of SPCs in the two populations provide excellent opportunities for joint studies and they also suggest that many underlying reasons for SPC may have universal and tangible causes that await mechanistic dissection.

"Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.",Anonymous,"OBJECTIVES: This collaborative study, based on data collected by the network of Italian association of cancer registries (AIRTUM), provides updated estimates on the incidence risk of multiple primary cancer (MP). The objective is to highlight and quantify the bidirectional associations between different oncological diseases. The quantification of the excess or decreased risk of further cancers in cancer patients, in comparison with the general population, may contribute to understand the aetiology of cancer and to address clinical follow-up., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data herein presented were provided by AIRTUM population-based cancer registries, which cover nowadays 48% of the Italian population. This monograph utilizes the AIRTUM database (December 2012), considering all malignant cancer cases diagnosed between 1976 and 2010. All cases are coded according to ICD-O-3. Non-melanoma skin cancer cases, cases based on death certificate only, cases based on autopsy only, and cases with follow-up time equal to zero were excluded. To define multiple primaries, IARC-IACR rules were adopted (http://www.iacr.com.fr/MPrules_july2004.pdf). Data were subjected to standard quality control procedures (described in the AIRTUM data management protocol) and specific quality control checks defined for the present study. A cohort of cancer patients was followed over time from first cancer diagnosis until the date of second cancer diagnosis, death, or the end of follow-up, to evaluate whether the number of observed second cancer cases was greater than expected. Person years at risk (PY) were computed by first cancer site, geographic area (North, Centre, South and Islands), attained age, and attained calendar-year group. All second cancers diagnosed in the cohort's patients were included in the observed numbers of cases. The expected number of cancer cases was computed multiplying the accumulated PY by the expected rates, calculated from the AIRTUM database stratified by cancer site, geographic area, age, and calendar-year group. The Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) was calculated as the ratio of observed to expected cancer cases. The Excess Absolute Risk (EAR) beyond the expected amount were calculated subtracting the expected number of subsequent cancers from the observed number of cancer cases; the difference was then divided by the PY and the number of cancer cases in excess (or deficit) was expressed per 1,000 PY. Confidence intervals were stated at 95%. The two months (60 days) after first cancer diagnosis were defined as ""synchronicity period"", and in the main analysis observed and expected cases during this period were excluded. It was estimated the excess risk in the period after first diagnosis (>= 0 months), excluding the synchronicity period (>= 2 months), and during the following periods: 2-11, 12-59, 60-119 and 120 months after diagnosis. First-cancer-site-and-gender-specific sheets are presented, reporting both SIRs and EARs., RESULTS: For 5,979,338 person-years a cohort of 1,635,060 cancer patients (880,361 males and 754,699 females) diagnosed between 1976 and 2010 was followed. The mean follow-up length was 14 years. Overall, 85,399 metachronous (latency >=2 months) cancers were observed, while 77,813 were expected during the study period: SIR: 1.10 (95%CI 1.09-1.10), EAR: 1.32 x 1,000 person-years (95%CI 1.19 - 1.46). The SIR was 1.08 (95%CI 1.08-1.09) for men (54,518 observed and 50,260 expected) and 1.12 (95%CI 1.11-1.13) for women (30,881/27,553), and the EAR 1.61 (95%CI 1.37-1.84) and 1.08 x 1,000 person-years (95%CI 0.93-1.24), respectively.Moreover, during the first two months after first cancer diagnosis (synchronous period) 14,807 cancers were observed while 3,536 were expected (SIR: 4.16; 95%CI 4.09-4.22); the SIR was 4.08 (95%CI 4.00-4.16) for men and 4.32 (95%CI 4.20-4.45) for women. The mean age of patients at first cancer diagnosis was 67.0 years among males and 65.8 among females. The risk of MP was related to age being higher for younger patients and lower for older ones. In relation to the time of first cancer diagnosis, the SIR was very high at the beginning and then decreased, although remaining constantly over 1, and then rose over time. No strong differences were evident across the different incidence periods, which all showed an increased MP risk.Women had higher SIRs than expected for 18 cancer sites, men for 12. The statistically significantly SIRs lower than 1 were 2 and 8, respectively. Increased overall MP risk was observed for patients of both sexes with a first primary in the oral cavity (SIR men: 1.93; SIR women: 1.48), pharynx (SIR men: 2.13; SIR women: 1.99), larynx (SIR men: 1.57; SIR women: 1.79), oesophagus (SIR men: 1.45; SIR women: 1.41), lung (SIR men: 1.09; SIR women: 1.13), kidney (SIR men: 1.14; SIR women: 1.15), urinary bladder (SIR men: 1.29; SIR women: 1.22), thyroid (SIR: 1.22 in both sexes), Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR men: 1.59; SIR women: 1.94), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR men: 1.13; SIR women: 1.12), and for the heterogeneous group ""other sites"" (SIR men: 1.09; SIR women: 1.07). Moreover, men had a higher MP risk if the first cancer was in the testis (SIR: 1.24), while the same was true for women with gallbladder (SIR: 1.21), skin melanoma (SIR: 1.17), bone (SIR: 1.41), breast (SIR: 1.12), cervix uteri (SIR: 1.23) and corpus uteri (SIR: 1.23), and ovarian cancer (SIR: 1.18). On the contrary, a first liver or pancreas cancer were associated with a decreased MP risk in both sexes (liver SIR: 0.86 and 0.81 for men and women, respectively; pancreas SIR: 0.70 and 0.78 for men and women, respectively), as were those of colon (SIR: 0.93), rectum (SIR: 0.83), gallbladder (SIR: 0.80), prostate (SIR: 0.93), mesothelioma (SIR: 0.65), and central nervous system (SIR: 0.82) among men. Among the cancers for which the EAR is statistically significant, those with higher Excess Absolute Risk of MP were those of the oral cavity (EAR: 16.0 x 1,000 person-years in men and 5.4 in women), pharynx (17.6 and 9.1), larynx (11.4 and 8.8), and oesophagus (8.5 and 4.8)., DISCUSSION: This descriptive study provides quantitative information on the risk of developing a second cancer in an Italian population-based cohort of approximately 1.65 million cancer patients, compared to the risk of the general population. During the follow-up time (on average 14 years) cancer patients had an MP risk that was 10% higher in comparison to the general population and an Excess Absolute Risk of 1.32 x 1,000 person-years. Study of MPs and their risk measures are dependent on methods used in the calculation. The definition of MP is not univocal and using different rules can greatly change the number of cancers in a patient with MPs. However, the AIRTUM cancer registries adopt the same recommendations for MP definition. This monograph was therefore made possible by the shared rules and standards used by AIRTUM registries. The cancer site-specific sheets, which represent the core of the monograph, can be useful to highlight and quantify the bidirectional associations among different diseases and therefore provide indications for clinical follow-up. Lifestyle changes in more healthful directions can have a positive effect in the cancer patient population and should always be recommended.",2013,/,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,37,4-5 Suppl 1,1-152,,,24259384,#2794,Anonymous 2013,,
Multiple malignant tumors.,"Chirila, D N; Turdeanu, N A; Constantea, N A; Coman, I; Pop, T; Popp, R A; Balacescu, O; Vesa, S C; Ciuce, C","BACKGROUND: Due to the improvement in diagnosis and therapy for certain malignant tumors, we are now faced with patients who develop in time multiple malignancies., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the patients diagnosed with at least two primary cancers that were admitted and treated in Cluj-Napoca Municipal Hospital. The study followed patients for a period of 7.5 years., RESULTS: We included in the present study 217 patients (4.33%) with two or more malignant primary tumors from 5003 cases diagnosed with a primary cancer. The most common sites for multiple malignant tumors were related to the breast, colorectum, urinary bladder, prostate and kidneys., CONCLUSIONS: We should always take into consideration the possibility of synchronous tumors and we have to keep in mind that a successful treatment of cancer might not prevent the onset of another primary mass.

Are transrectal prostate biopsies routinely indicated in patients with incidentally diagnosed prostate cancer following transurethral resection of the prostate for benign disease?.,"Lee, Lui Shiong; Thiruneelakandasivam, Suntharasivam; Hong, Matthew K; Peters, Justin S; Warren, Anne; Mills, Rob; Greenberg, David; Wright, Karen; Gnanapragasam, Vincent","OBJECTIVE: To determine the indication of routine transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy (TRUSBx) of the prostate gland following incidental cancer diagnosis after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for benign prostatic hyperplasia., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi-institutional search identified 63 patients with incidental TURP-diagnosed prostate cancer from 2001 to 2010, who underwent subsequent TRUSBx or radical prostatectomy (RP). The Gleason scores from TURP were compared to those from TRUSBx or RP. Whole mount maps from RP were analysed to provide an anatomical basis for the correlation observed. To determine the clinical impact of this problem, the incidence of TURP-diagnosed prostate cancer in the population was also determined., RESULTS: Of 22 patients who underwent TRUSBx, the rates of Gleason score concordance, upgrading and downgrading were 32, 14 and 54% respectively (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.20). Most cases of pathological downgrading consisted of benign cores at biopsy. Therefore, TRUSBx did not give additional Gleason score (GS) information in 86% of patients. Of 41 RP patients, the respective rates were 61, 22 and 17% (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.15). The majority of them retained a similar or lower GS between TURP and RP. Of 13 whole mount maps analysed, 6 (46%) were found with anterior/transitional zone (AZ/TZ) tumours, 6 (46%) with multifocal tumours and 1 (8%) with a large peripheral zone (PZ) tumour extending into the TZ. Regional population data show that despite a gradual reduction in the proportion of TURP-diagnosed cases over the past decade, they still account for 8.5-13% of all new cases., CONCLUSION: TURP-diagnosed prostate cancers represent predominantly AZ tumours. A TRUSBx does not give additional GS information in a majority of cases, and therefore is not routinely indicated. It may be selectively useful prior to active surveillance, but not in all pursuing radical treatment. These findings may help reduce unnecessary TRUSBx in the population. Copyright © 2013 S.

Multimodality therapy for patients with high-risk prostate cancer: current status and future directions.,"Zaorsky, Nicholas G; Trabulsi, Edouard J; Lin, Jianqing; Den, Robert B","Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second most common cause of cancer death in American men. Although high-risk disease accounts for less than 15% of diagnoses, high-risk prostate cancer patients have a cancer-specific mortality rate of 15% at 10 years. There is currently no consensus on the optimal management of high-risk disease because (1) there are different primary modalities available (ie, surgery, radiation), for which there are no randomized trials comparing efficacy; and (2) unstandardized timing of different therapies (ie, neoadjuvant v concurrent v adjuvant), which makes comparisons of efficacy problematic. Increased understanding into the mechanisms leading to the formation of advanced metastatic disease has spurred the development of agents to target these pathways. However, new questions regarding optimal management of disease arise with regard to the role of these therapies in combination with ""conventional"" primary modalities for earlier stage, high-risk prostate cancer patients. In this article, we review the transforming world of multimodality therapy in high-risk prostate cancer. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Synchronous and metachronous malignancies: analysis of the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs (VA) tumor registry.,"Powell, Steven; Tarchand, Gobind; Rector, Thomas; Klein, Mark","PURPOSE: Multiple primary malignancies (MPMs) are increasing as cancer survivorship improves. A large analysis of the SEER database estimates that approximately 16 % of new cancers reported to their registry represent a second or higher order malignancy. The purpose of this study is to estimate the number of MPM diagnoses and to define differences in synchronous and metachronous cancers in the Veterans Affairs (VA) population., METHODS: The primary objective of this study was to determine the proportion of second or higher order cancers diagnosed at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009. The secondary objectives were to analyze and compare correlative demographic, exposure, clinical, and tumor data among those with synchronous and metachronous malignancies. We included any patient with a diagnosis of a malignant cancer during the study period., RESULT: A total of 4,449 patients were diagnosed with malignancies during the study period. Of these, 506 patients (11.4 % of cancer diagnoses) had a diagnosis of a second or higher order malignancy. Of the 506 patients, 124 (24.3 %) had synchronous malignancies and 383 (75.5 %) had metachronous malignancies. The most common malignancy pairing was prostate cancer with bladder/ureter cancer (12 %) of MPM diagnoses. Differences between patients with synchronous and metachronous second occurrences were identified., CONCLUSION: Multiple primary malignancies are a growing area of interest in cancer survivorship. At our institution, approximately 1 in 9 new cancer diagnoses during the 5-year study period represented second-order malignancies. Our data suggest that the VA population is at risk of developing second primary cancers.

"Incidental prostate cancer in patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma: comprehensive analysis of 1,476 radical cystoprostatectomy specimens.","Bruins, Harman Maxim; Djaladat, Hooman; Ahmadi, Hamed; Sherrod, Andy; Cai, Jie; Miranda, Gus; Skinner, Eila Curlee; Daneshmand, Siamak","PURPOSE: We identified risk factors and determined the incidence and prognosis of incidental, clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma, prostatic urothelial carcinoma and HGPIN in patients treated with radical cystoprostatectomy for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the records of 1,476 patients without a history of prostatic adenocarcinoma. We determined the incidence of clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma, prostatic urothelial carcinoma and HGPIN in the total cohort and in select patient subgroups. Prostatic urothelial carcinoma was stratified as prostatic stromal and prostatic urethral/duct involvement. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with multiple variables. Recurrence-free and overall survival rates were calculated. Median followup was 13.2 years., RESULTS: Of the 1,476 patients 753 (51.0%) had cancer involving the prostate. Prostatic adenocarcinoma, clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma, prostatic urothelial carcinoma and HGPIN were present in 37.9%, 8.3%, 21.1% and 51.2% of patients, respectively. Of the 312 patients (21.1%) with prostatic urothelial carcinoma 163 (11.0%) had prostatic urethral/duct involvement only and 149 (10.1%) had prostatic stromal involvement. We identified risk factors for clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma, prostatic urothelial carcinoma and HGPIN but the absence of these risk factors did not rule out their presence. Ten-year overall survival in patients with no prostatic urothelial carcinoma, and prostatic urethral/duct and prostatic stromal involvement was 47.1%, 43.3% and 21.7%, respectively (p<0.001). No patient with clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma died of prostatic cancer., CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy had cancer involving the prostate. Prostatic urothelial carcinoma, particularly with prostatic stromal involvement, was associated with a worse prognosis, while clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma did not alter survival. Preoperative clinical and histopathological risk factors are not reliable enough to accurately predict clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma and/or prostatic urothelial carcinoma.

Risk of mesothelioma following external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a cohort analysis of SEER database.,"Farioli, Andrea; Violante, Francesco Saverio; Mattioli, Stefano; Curti, Stefania; Kriebel, David","PURPOSE: To investigate the association between external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer and mesothelioma using data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries., METHODS: We analyzed data from the SEER database (1973-2009). We compared EBRT versus no radiotherapy. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) of mesothelioma among prostate cancer patients were estimated with multilevel Poisson models adjusted by race, age, and calendar year. Confounding by asbestos was investigated using relative risk of mesothelioma in each case's county of residence as a proxy for asbestos exposure., RESULTS: Four hundred and seventy-one mesothelioma cases (93.6 % pleural) occurred in 3,985,991 person-years. The IRR of mesothelioma was increased for subjects exposed to EBRT (1.28; 95 % CI 1.05, 1.55) compared to non-irradiated patients, and a population attributable fraction of 0.49 % (95 % CI 0.11, 0.81) was estimated. The IRR increased with latency period: 0-4 years, IRR 1.08 (95 % CI 0.81, 1.44); 5-9 years, IRR 1.31 (95 % CI 0.93, 1.85); >=10 years, IRR 1.59 (95 % CI 1.05, 2.42). Despite the fairly strong evidence of association with EBRT, the population attributable rate of mesothelioma was modest-3.3 cases per 100,000 person-years. The cumulative incidence of mesothelioma attributable to EBRT was 4.0/100,000 over 5 years, 24.5/100,000 over 10 years, and 65.0/100,000 over 15 years., CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that EBRT for prostate cancer is a small but detectable risk factor for mesothelioma.

Surgical management of a locally advanced symptomatic recurrence of penile sarcoma secondary to prostate brachytherapy.,"Hakky, Tariq S; Espiritu, Patrick; Rodriguez, Alejandro R; Gould, Nicholas; Spiess, Philippe E","UNLABELLED: The surgical management of patients with symptomatic metastatic or locally advanced recurrences involving the penis remains poorly characterized. The aim of the present abstract and video is to detail our experience in the surgical management of a specific patient with a locally advanced symptomatic recurrence of penile sarcoma secondary to prostate cancer treated with primary brachytherapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 70 year old male patient initially treated for localized prostate cancer with interstitial brachytherapy at an outside facility developed an unfortunate secondary malignancy consisting of a locally advanced penile sarcoma involving as well the prostate and base of the bladder. Despite our best efforts to control his pain, he developed a very symptomatic local recurrence with a secondary penile abscess and purulent periurethral drainage. At this time, it was felt a surgical resection consisting of a total penectomy, urethrectomy, cystoprostatectomy, and ileal conduit urinary diversion would be the best option for local cancer control in this particular patient., RESULTS: The patient underwent the surgical resection without any complications as illustrated in this surgical video, with a jejunal intestinal mass identified at the time of surgery which was resected with a primary bowel anastomosis performed. The patient was discharged from hospital uneventfully with his symptomatic local recurrence being successfully managed and the patient no longer requiring oral narcotics for pain control. The pathological report confirmed a locally advanced sarcoma involving the penile, prostate, and bladder which was resected with negative surgical margins and the jejunal mass was confirmed to represent a small bowel sarcoma metastatic site., CONCLUSION: As highlighted in the present video, the treatment of a symptomatic sarcoma local recurrence contiguously involving the penis can be successfully managed provided the patient is informed of the potential morbidity and psychosocial implications imparted by performing a total penectomy and adjacent organ resection.",2013,/,International braz j urol : official journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology,39,2,293-4,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2013.02.21,23683678,#2802,Hakky 2013,,

O/E ratios for prevalent EPMs were significantly increased for colorectal carcinoma (2.26; CI 95% 1.17-3.96), renal cell carcinoma (6.00; CI 95% 2.74-11.39) and thyroid carcinoma (5.56; CI 95% 1.80-12.96). Increased age, heavy cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and first-degree family history of gastric cancer are significant risk factors for EPMs, while first-degree family history of colorectal carcinoma was borderline., CONCLUSION: We report an increased prevalence of EPMs in Italian patients with IPMN, especially for colorectal carcinoma, renal cell and thyroid cancers.

Sebaceous carcinoma in the clinical setting of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: the Mayo Clinic experience.,"Chang, Timothy W; Weaver, Amy L; Brewer, Jerry D","OBJECTIVES: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a hematologic malignancy associated with the more aggressive behavior of some forms of skin cancer. An association between sebaceous carcinoma and immunosuppression has been identified, but the behavior of sebaceous carcinoma in the setting of non-Hodgkin lymphoma has not been studied. This study aimed to increase understanding of the behavior of sebaceous carcinoma in patients with concomitant non-Hodgkin lymphoma., METHODS: Six patients diagnosed with sebaceous carcinoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma from 1976 to 2008 were identified at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Their charts were reviewed retrospectively., RESULTS: All six patients were male and White and presented with sebaceous carcinoma on non-eyelid regions of the head and neck. Two patients had Muir-Torre syndrome; four had secondary cancers that included colon, prostate, transitional cell, and urothelial cancers. Skin cancers other than sebaceous carcinoma included basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Three patients died of causes unrelated to sebaceous carcinoma; one died of an unknown cause and two were alive at the time of the study., CONCLUSIONS: Sebaceous carcinoma does not appear to behave more aggressively in the setting of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Screening for new primary cancers in cancer survivors compared to non-cancer controls: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Corkum, Mark; Hayden, Jill A; Kephart, George; Urquhart, Robin; Schlievert, Coralynne; Porter, Geoffrey","PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to synthesize evidence comparing cancer screening receipt between cancer survivors and non-cancer controls by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis., METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases from inception through April 1, 2010 using search terms related to cancer, survivorship, and cancer screening. Studies were included if they reported a comparison of cancer screening receipt between cancer survivors and non-cancer controls. We performed a meta-analysis on the effect of cancer survivorship on breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening receipt., RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 1,778 titles, of which 20 met our inclusion/exclusion criteria. In our meta-analyses, cancer survivors were more likely to be screened for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer than non-cancer controls (pooled odds ratio, 1.27; 95 % CI, 1.19-1.36). We observed significant heterogeneity between studies, most of which remained unexplained after subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Important contextual factors, such as how screening programs operate, were not reported in the primary literature. Many cancer survivors (along with non-cancer controls) still did not receive cancer screening., CONCLUSION: Compared with non-cancer controls, cancer survivors receive more frequent screening for new primary breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers. Future research should seek to determine whether increased uptake of cancer screening is associated with improved outcomes during cancer survivorship., IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that cancer survivors received more frequent screening for second primary breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers than non-cancer controls.

Metachronous cancer.,"Glicksman, Arvin S; Fulton, John P","Metachronous cancer (multiple primary tumors developing at intervals) will appear more commonly as cancer patients live longer lives. In this report, we use data from the Rhode Island Cancer Registry to look at commonly occurring metachronous cancers, their frequency over time, and the implications for cancer survivorship. Sequence two (refers to the chronologically second primary tumor diagnosed for a given patient) and higher primary malignant neoplasms were identified in cancer case reports made to the Rhode Island Cancer Registry, 1987-2009, and used to construct annual, age-adjusted, sequence-specific incidence rates for all cancers combined, and age-adjusted, site-specific incidence rates for common second and higher-order primary malignant neoplasms over the entire observational period. During the period of observation, the proportion of all cancers diagnosed as sequence two and higher primary tumors among males increased steadily from 11.5 to 20.3 percent, while the proportion of all cancers diagnosed as sequence two and higher primary tumors among females increased from 12.8 to 20.7 percent. A mere four cancer types--lung (and bronchus), colon (and rectum), breast, and prostate--account for over half of all sequence two and higher cancer diagnoses (54.3 percent). The average interval between first cancers and second cancers is 6.5 years for men and 4.8 years for women. Such is the ""career"" of a cancer survivor today that he or she has about a one in four chance of developing a second cancer. This statistic suggests the need for strong and lasting social support networks. Furthermore, the average interval between first and second cancers is substantial, and suggests opportunities for interventions (prevention and screening) that might reduce the burden of sequence two and higher cancers.",2013,/,Rhode Island medical journal (2013),96,4,Apr-41,,,23641452,#2806,Glicksman 2013,,

VEGF is among the most potent angiogenic factor thus far detected. The aim of the present study is to explore the potential of VEGF (also known as VEGF-A) as a prognostic and predictive biomarker among men with locally advanced prostate cancer., METHODS: The analysis was performed using patients enrolled on RTOG 8610, a phase III randomized control trial of radiation therapy alone (Arm 1) versus short-term neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen deprivation and radiation therapy (Arm 2) in men with locally advanced prostate carcinoma. Tissue samples were obtained from the RTOG tissue repository. Hematoxylin and eosin slides were reviewed, and paraffin blocks were immunohistochemically stained for VEGF expression and graded by Intensity score (0-3). Cox or Fine and Gray's proportional hazards models were used., RESULTS: Sufficient pathologic material was available from 103 (23%) of the 456 analyzable patients enrolled in the RTOG 8610 study. There were no statistically significant differences in the pre-treatment characteristics between the patient groups with and without VEGF intensity data. Median follow-up for all surviving patients with VEGF intensity data is 12.2 years. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated no statistically significant correlation between the intensity of VEGF expression and overall survival, distant metastasis, local progression, disease-free survival, or biochemical failure. VEGF expression was also not statistically significantly associated with any of the endpoints when analyzed by treatment arm., CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed no statistically significant prognostic or predictive value of VEGF expression for locally advanced prostate cancer.
