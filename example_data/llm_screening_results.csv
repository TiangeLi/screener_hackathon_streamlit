Abstract: BACKGROUND: Improvements in cancer survival have made the long-term risks from treatments more important, including the risk of developing a second cancer after radiotherapy. We aimed to estimate the proportion of second cancers attributable to radiotherapy in adults with data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registries., METHODS: We used nine of the SEER registries to systematically analyse 15 cancer sites that are routinely treated with radiotherapy (oral and pharynx, salivary gland, rectum, anus, larynx, lung, soft tissue, female breast, cervix, endometrial, prostate, testes, eye and orbit, brain and CNS, and thyroid). The cohort we studied was composed of patients aged 20 years or older who were diagnosed with a first primary invasive solid cancer reported in the SEER registries between Jan 1, 1973, and Dec 31, 2002. Relative risks (RRs) for second cancer in patients treated with radiotherapy versus patients not treated with radiotherapy were estimated with Poisson regression adjusted for age, stage, and other potential confounders., FINDINGS: 647,672 cancer patients who were 5-year survivors were followed up for a mean 12 years (SD 4.5, range 5-34); 60,271 (9%) developed a second solid cancer. For each of the first cancer sites the RR of developing a second cancer associated with radiotherapy exceeded 1, and varied from 1.08 (95% CI 0.79-1.46) after cancers of the eye and orbit to 1.43 (1.13-1.84) after cancer of the testes. In general, the RR was highest for organs that typically received greater than 5 Gy, decreased with increasing age at diagnosis, and increased with time since diagnosis. We estimated a total of 3266 (2862-3670) excess second solid cancers that could be related to radiotherapy, that is 8% (7-9) of the total in all radiotherapy patients (>=1 year survivors) and five excess cancers per 1000 patients treated with radiotherapy by 15 years after diagnosis., INTERPRETATION: A relatively small proportion of second cancers are related to radiotherapy in adults, suggesting that most are due to other factors, such as lifestyle or genetics., FUNDING: US National Cancer Institute.

Abstract: Purpose: In this study we evaluated the risk of a second malignancy of the bladder or prostate in patients with a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) or urothelial cancer (TCC). Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed all cases of PCa and TCC diagnosed between January 1996 and June 2003. Only PCa diagnosed due to abnormal digital rectal examination or increased prostate specific antigen were included. All patients with TCC presented with hematuria or irritative voiding symptoms and the diagnoses were confirmed with a tissue diagnosis. The incidence of lung, colon and renal cancers was also analyzed. Result(s): A total of 816 men were diagnosed with PCa and/or TCC. Of 673 men initially diagnosed with PCa 21 had TCC. Of 149 men initially diagnosed with TCC 18 had PCa. Average age at PCa and TCC diagnosis +/- SD was 68.2 +/- 7.9 and 68.2 +/- 10.4 years, respectively. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of TCC in patients with PCa (SIR 4.31, 95% CI 2.411 to 7.110) and of PCa in patients with TCC (SIR 3.83, 95% CI 1.911 to 6.858) was significantly increased. There was no statistical significant difference in SIR for TCC in men with or without radiotherapy. SIR for lung, renal or colon cancer was not significantly different from what was expected. Conclusion(s): Patients with PCa have higher incidence of bladder cancer and those with bladder cancer have a higher incidence of PCa. This study has clinical implications in the care of these patients and it may stimulate research interest that may identify common pathways of carcinogenesis. © 2008 American Urological Association."

Abstract: AIM: The feasibility and outcome of sphincter-saving resection for rectal cancer were assessed in patients previously treated by high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer., METHOD: Between 2000 and 2012, 1066 patients underwent rectal excision for rectal cancer. Of these, 236 were treated by conventional radiotherapy (45 Gy) and sphincter-saving resection (Group A) and 12 were treated by external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer (70 Gy) and sphincter-saving resection (Group B) of whom five had a metachronous and seven a synchronous cancer. The end-points were surgical morbidity, pelvic sepsis, reoperation and definitive stoma., RESULTS: Tumour characteristics were similar in both groups. Surgical morbidity (67% vs 25%, P = 0.004), anastomotic leakage (50% vs 10%, P = 0.001, and reoperation (50% vs 17%, P = 0.011) were significantly higher in Group B. Multivariate analyses showed that EBRT for prostate cancer was the only independent factor for anastomotic leakage (OR = 5.12; 95% CI 1.45-18.08; P = 0.011) and definitive stoma (OR = 10.56; 95% CI 3.02-39.92; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: High-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases morbidity from rectal surgery and the risk of a permanent stoma. This suggests that a delayed coloanal anastomosis or a Hartmann procedure should be proposed as an alternative to low anterior resection in this population.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Speculation remains that GH treatment is associated with increased neoplasia risk. Studies in GH-treated childhood cancer survivors suggested higher rates of second neoplasms, while cancer risk data for GH-treated and untreated hypopituitary adults have been variable. We present primary cancer risk data from the Hypopituitary Control and Complications Study (HypoCCS) with a focus on specific cancers, and assessment of recurrence rates for pituitary adenomas (PA) and craniopharyngiomas (CP)., DESIGN: Incident neoplasms during HypoCCS were evaluated in 8418 GH-treated vs 1268 untreated patients for primary malignancies, 3668 GH-treated vs 720 untreated patients with PA history, and 956 GH-treated vs 102 untreated patients with CP history., METHODS: Using population cancer rates, standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for all primary cancers, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Neoplasm rates in GH-treated vs untreated patients were analysed after propensity score adjustment of baseline treatment group imbalances., RESULTS: During mean follow-up of 4.8 years, 225 primary cancers were identified in GH-treated patients, with SIR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.71-0.93). SIRs (95% CI) for GH-treated patients were 0.59 (0.36-0.90) for breast, 0.80 (0.57-1.10) for prostate, and 0.62 (0.38-0.96) for colorectal cancers.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To understand the threat posed by localized prostate cancer and the potential impact of surgery or radiation, patients and healthcare providers require information on long-term outcomes following conservative management., OBJECTIVE: To describe 15-yr survival outcomes and cancer therapy utilization among men 65 years and older managed conservatively for newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer., DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a population-based cohort study with participants living in predefined geographic areas covered by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. The study includes 31 137 Medicare patients aged >=65 yr diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in 1992-2009 who initially received conservative management (no surgery, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]). All patients were followed until death or December 31, 2009 (for prostate cancer-specific mortality [PCSM]) and December 31, 2011 (for overall mortality)., OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Competing-risk analyses were used to examine PCSM, overall mortality, and utilization of cancer therapies., RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The 15-yr risk of PCSM for men aged 65-74 yr diagnosed with screening-detected prostate cancer was 5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7-8.0%) for T1c Gleason 5-7 and 22% (95% CI 16-35%) for Gleason 8-10 disease. After 15 yr of follow-up, 24% (95% CI 21-27%) of men aged 65-74 yr with screening-detected Gleason 5-7 cancer received ADT. The corresponding result for men with Gleason 8-10 cancer was 38% (95% CI 32-44%). The major study limitations are the lack of data for men aged <65 yr and detailed clinical information associated with secondary cancer therapy., CONCLUSIONS: The 15-yr outcomes following conservative management of newly diagnosed Gleason 5-7 prostate cancer among men aged >=65 yr are excellent. Men with Gleason 8-10 disease managed conservatively face a significant risk of PCSM., PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the long-term survival outcomes for a large group of patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who did not have surgery, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or androgen deprivation therapy in the first 6 mo after cancer diagnosis. We found that the 15-yr disease-specific survival is excellent for men diagnosed with Gleason 5-7 disease. The data support conservative management as a reasonable choice for elderly patients with low-grade localized prostate cancer. Copyright © 2015 European Association of Urology.
